A combat medic is an artificer who has developed mechanisms by which to support others in battle beyond their infusions or magic items, keeping their allies' vigor up and prolonging their usefulness in battle.

## Tool Proficiency

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You gain proficiency with the healer's kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

## Combat Medic Spells

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Combat Medic Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

## Nouliths

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You have developed a set of nouliths, four magically empowered turrets that sit sheathed upon your back, but can be made to float around you with a simple mental command, requiring no action from you, or return them to your back in the same manner.

The nouliths are a magical ranged weapon that deal 1d6 force damage, with a range of 30/120 feet. When attacking with the nouliths, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

## Kardia

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You have learned to achieve an arcane connection with an ally, which lets you channel power to them during combat to help keep them invigorated and fighting ready. As an action, you choose a willing creature you can see to give them your Kardia.

Whenever you deal damage with your nouliths, X, Y, or Z, the ally who has your Kardia gains temporary HP equal to the damage you dealt.
