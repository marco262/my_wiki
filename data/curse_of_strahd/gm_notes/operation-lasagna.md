The players left Baba Lysaga's house (with a familiar with a connection to Baba Lysaga) and immediately went to start talking with the Keepers of the Feather and Uncle David. They went through a bunch of plans to distract her and mess with her house and the like, until Uncle David pointed out their familiar is a spy for her. They smashed the familiar, and have to assume Baba Lysaga heard everything they planned.

So the players now have to come up with new plans. >:) Current plans include:

* Hunt down an NPC to help them plan (they want to hunt down Van Richten)
* Use wolf musk somehow (I love this, make this work!)

Van Richten will not necessarily be easy to find, but there should be ways to get to him.

* Most obvious one is to check out his tower. He will either be there, or will be there eventually.
* Hire someone to cast Sending. Harder to accomplish, since there are very few spellcasters in Barovia who can cast 3rd level spells.
  * Esmerelda? The Abbot?
* Paper Birds? Where would they find them?
  * Remember that anyone in Van Richten's Tower is protected from Divination magic, including Sending or Paper Birds.
* Ask Keepers of the Feather to keep an eye out for him
* Any scheme the players want to come up with

Van Richten will be reluctant to help them. Baba Lysaga is not an Elder Vampire, she's dangerous, and is not a direct ally of Strahd. He does know that Strahd is protected by the Fanes, but doesn't know Baba Lysaga has one of the keys. If the players reveal she's in possession of the spindle, he'll quickly put the pieces together and decide to help them out. Van Richten will insist on having further discussions at his tower, and Detect Magic up at all times to determine if divination magic is nearby while they're on their way.

What does Van Richten know about Baba Lysaga? Come up with some good answers.

What plans does Van Richten have to mess with Baba Lysaga? Come up with something lol

Van Richten will come up with an excuse to talk to Ireena alone. Giving her cleric lessons? Make it Ireena's idea? He will want to convince her that one viable option to end Strahd forever is to go through with the Bride Ceremony, and kill herself in the middle of it. 

Why would Ireena agree? Van Richten will appeal to her sense of duty and the value of noble sacrifice. She can be the one to free all the people in Barovia from Strahd's Curse. He'll also convince her to not share this plan with the heroes, because Strahd is painfully smart, deceitful, and can scry just as well as Baba Lysaga. The PCs are also not the most discreet folks around, so the fewer people that know this plan, the better.

# What the Player Know about Baba Lysaga

* Vain, egotistical, arrogant, and fiercely intelligent
* An ancient hag, who you should NOT make deals with or take gifts from
