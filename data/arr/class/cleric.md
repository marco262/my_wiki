Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips to Azeyma, an elezen begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions. 

Bleeding and weary, an auri summons the power of the arcane and the divine together. With one mighty sweep, his companion's wounds knit together and the demon lord's hold on them is broken.

Chanting a song of glory, a roegadyn swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of imperials arrayed against him, shouting praise to Rhalgr with every foe's fall.

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the Twelve. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of the Twelve in the mortal realm. At times the Twelve work through them; others, the cleric manifests the will of their patron god through fervent prayer and iron belief.

### Healers and Warriors
Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and  hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the Twelve on their side.

### Divine Agents
Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. In fact, very very few can be said to have the strength of will and pure certainty that a Cleric needs to manifest the effects their god demands. When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. 

Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.

## Creating a Cleric

As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. Appendix B in the Player's Handbook includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.

Once you've chosen a deity, consider your cleric's relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?

## Quick Build

You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the [[[background:Acolyte]]] background.

# Class Features

As a cleric, you gain the following class features.

## Hit Points

* Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level
* Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
* Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st

## Proficiencies

* Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields
* Weapons: All simple weapons
* Tools: None
* Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma
* Skills: Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

## Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient)
* (a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)
* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* A shield and a holy symbol

## Spellcasting

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See [[[general:Spellcasting Rules]]] and the [cleric spell list](/dnd/class_spell_list/cleric/true).

### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher.[((bibcite errata))] To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells When you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

* Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
* Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

#### Domains
Choose one domain from the following list related to your deity. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

|      [War](/dnd/subclass/War-domain)      |       Halone the Fury, Rhalgr the Destroyer        | *PHB*  |

### Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of spells -- its domain spells -- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

### Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

[[accordion Optional Class Features: Harness Divine Power]]

### Harness Divine Power

_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, p. 30_

_2nd-level cleric feature_

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

[[/accordion]]

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

[[accordion Optional Class Features: Cantrip Versatility]]

## Cantrip Versatility

_Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, p. 31_

_4th-level cleric feature_

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.

[[/accordion]]

## Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

||~ Cleric Level ||~ Destroys Undead of CR ||
|| 5th || 1/2 or lower ||
|| 8th || 1 or lower ||
|| 11th || 2 or lower ||
|| 14th || 3 or lower ||
|| 17th || 4 or lower ||

## Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
