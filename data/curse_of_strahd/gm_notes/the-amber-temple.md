# Notes

Before going into the Amber Temple, tell the players the following things:

* This is a dungeon, and I will be running it like one.
* This means monsters, random encounters, traps, secret doors, and the like.
* Just because you've previously explored a room does not mean it's guaranteed to be safe when you return.
* Not every room in the dungeon will have something interesting, but exploration *will* be rewarded (if you look in the right places).
* You do *not* need to fight everything you come across in this dungeon.
* Getting out alive is not guaranteed, nor are you guaranteed to safely take rests here.
* Your choice of whether to bring a light source will be important. Having a light source means it will be easier to see around you, but it may tip off things in the dungeon that you're approaching.
* Reminder: If you have darkvision, you treat complete darkness as dim light. This means that any Perception check related to sight is made at disadvantage. This means that it's easier for things to sneak up on you in darkness, even if you have darkvision.
* What loot you can carry out will be limited by your carrying capacity (15 x Strength score), so take some time to work out the weight of the items you currently have on hand. If you don't know the weight of any of your items, let me know and I'll tell you.

# Rooms

## X1. Temple Facade

[Link](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,14,x1.%20temple%20facade,0)

The following inscription has been carved into the frame above the front door into the Amber Temple:

> *If you seek honor or power, turn back - for these walls hold naught but doom.*  
> *In amber tombs below, the darkness shelters a timeless evil.*  
> *This temple is infected with a scourge of malevolent divinity.*  
> *Our arrogance and folly forged this place into our prison.*  
> *Leave now, before our damnation becomes yours.*

* A character with a passive Perception of 15 or greater notices that the snow to the left side of the temple entrance appears to have been traversed recently. A DC 15 Survival check reveals a set of human footprints alongside a much larger pair of canine paw prints leading to Area X1a (Narrow Fissure). A DC 15 Nature check can identify the paw prints as belonging to a winter wolf.

## X4. Overlook

[Link](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,14,x4.%20overlook,0)

> A twenty-foot-wide balcony of black marble with a shattered railing overlooks a vast temple. Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend thirty feet to the temple floor. The vaulted ceiling is thirty feet above the balcony. The walls and ceiling are covered in an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen. A set of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony. A similar pair stands open to the east.
>
> The balcony railing before you is battered and bent, as if it was struck with great force and bent inwards. Laid across the crooked metal is a corpse, a mix of exposed bone and dried flesh, long ago mummified by the extreme cold of the mountains. Its head hangs back, empty eye sockets staring at you in frozen horror. A dark splotch of long-dried blood has pooled beneath the body, dripping off the edge of the balcony to the darkness beyond.
>
> Beyond this corpse, you can see the dark shapes of others, strewn about the stairs leading downwards, and all along the dark marble floor below.

* [Visual Aid](^curse_of_strahd/TempleofLostSecrets.mp4)
* **Reminder**: Mention that Orin and Marblepaw's darkvision is limited here.

## X5. Temple of Lost Secrets

[Link](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,14,x5.%20temple%20of%20lost%20secrets,0)

> Four black marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of the temple, at the north end of which stands a forty-foot-tall statue of a cowled figure in flowing robes. The statue's stony hands are outstretched as if in the midst of casting a spell. Its face is a void of utter blackness. The ominous statue stands between two black marble balconies, one of which has partially collapsed and fallen on the temple's black marble floor, in front of an open doorway. The walls of the temple are sheathed in amber, and the doors leading from it are made of amber as well. Arched hallways coated with amber lead away from the temple to the west and east. Flanking these exits are alcoves that hold white marble statues of robed human wizards with pointed hats and golden staffs. One of them has toppled over and lies shattered on the floor.
>
> Corpses litter the dark marble floor all around you. Limbs and bodies and heads and bones bump against your boots or crunch underfoot, a macabre museum of an ancient battleground. Though despite the death you're surrounded by, the stench of rot is conspicuously absent. The area right in front of the statue is piled up with corpses and bones, as if they were a collection of some monstrous creature.

The amount of knowledge stored within this single room seems unfathomable.

    * Upon meeting the PCs, he'll flinch away from them in abject terror, begging for his life. Once calmed, he'll tell them a tragic story to try and get them on his side:
        * That his family has been unfortunate enough to be afflicted by a terrible disease. He lies and says that it's not contagious, and stays within his family (basically saying it's genetic).
        * Vilnius will tell the PCs that he has a daughter who's shown signs of the disease. While it's too late for him, he desperately wants to find a cure for her. He's heard that such a cure lies somewhere in the Temple, but the various monsters and creatures have kept him from moving on any further.
        * Vilnius then begs the party to escort him deeper into the temple where a miracle cure-all is said to be hidden.

> This small 10 foot by 10 foot room feels claustrophobic. Unlike the rest of the temple, with its cavernous ceilings, this room dips down to a low 6 feet and change, making Ethel want to duck her head. The everpresent oppressive darkness of the temple seems to press in further, crowding the edges of your vision, filling your ears with a noiseless hum. As such, your eyes are drawn even more strongly to the [door](^curse_of_strahd/lich_study_door.jpg) in front of you.
> 
> This oaken door stands out as the only wooden door you've seen in this amber-themed fortress. Its wood is carved with artistic reliefs of symbols and figures. It's banded with metal on all sides, clearly meant to reinforce it. But the most prominent feature of the door is its magic circle inscribed in the middle. Glowing blue lines run through the metal and wood, not like they were carved out of the door after the fact, but that the material itself was shaped with the lines in mind. Runic symbols seem to float an inch off the wood, fading in and out of view, to be replaced by others that then float away to nothingness after a few moments. You can *feel* the magic imbued in it, like an immovable barrier before you.
> 
> Three locks surround the magic circle, placed at equidistant points. Magic lines run like threads through the wood and metal from the circle into the locks themselves, tying them to whatever magical enchantment is before you.

Lockpicking DC is 25. Anyone who fails to pick a lock is thrown forcefully away from the door, taking 4d6 falling damage, DC 20 Dex save for half. When a lockpicking check fails, any other locks that were successfully picked reset.

The DC for breaking down the door is 30. Failure is the same as failing to pick a lock above.

### Corruption Rules

Each time a creature uses a dark gift received from one of the vestiges of the Amber Temple, it must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw; on a failure, the creature gains a stage of corruption. Creatures accrue corruption from different dark gifts separately.

Orin is drawn to the South Sarcophagus, containing Pesir-Temni, the Dark Poet.

> A vision appears before you of a [dark parlour](^curse_of_strahd/dark_study.jpg) lit by flickering candlelight and moonlight coming in through a single window. An ornate desk is pushed up against the wall, with a [pale woman in black](^curse_of_strahd/pesir_temni_1.png) ([1](^curse_of_strahd/pesir_temni_2.png), [2](^curse_of_strahd/pesir_temni_3.png)) seated before it. She's scribbling on a parchment by candlelight, the quill in her hand dancing across the page. She turns to look your way, and she smiles at you. Her face is as pale at the moon, her lips painted ruby red. Her eyes are two black pools, and jet black tears of mascara mar her perfect cheeks. She wears a veil of black lace over her long, blonde hair.
> 
> She puts down the quill and turns towards you, beckoning you closer with one painted nail. When you approach, she says in a voice like dry leaves in an autumn wind, "I am Pesir-Temni, the Dark Poet. Welcome to my abode, my champion."

She offers Orin her dark gift: the power to instill great passion in others. To accept, Orin must prick his finger with her quill, and sign her parchment with his blood. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the ability to cast the *[excite emotions](/dnd/spell/Excite Emotions)* spell three times per day without components.

***Corruption Effects***

* **Stage 1.** The creature gains a +3 bonus to its Charisma score and the flaw: "I do not feel joy, sorrow, or love - only hate, rage, and apathy." Its form becomes ethereal and clouded in shadow, and its eyes glow yellow.
* **Stage 2.** The creature gains the [Incorporeal Movement](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#wraith_mm) feature, Life Drain attack, and the flaw: "I despise reminders of what I once was, and what I have become."
* **Stage 3.** The creature transforms into a [wraith](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#wraith_mm) under the DM's control.

Marblepaw is drawn to the East Sarcophagus, containing Amberstripe, She of Many Lives.

> You find yourself in a [dark forest](^curse_of_strahd/dark_forest_1.png) ([1](^curse_of_strahd/dark_forest_2.png), [2](^curse_of_strahd/dark_forest_3.png)), one you've never seen before. The trees tower around you, their trunks fuzzy and barely visible in the dimness that even your sensitive eyes can't completely pierce. All around you, the air is deathly still. Not a single breeze brushes past your whiskers, and though your ears turn all around, you cannot hear a single breath of another living thing. And yet, you cannot shake the feeling you are being watched.
> 
> The low-slung form of [a tortoiseshell](^curse_of_strahd/amberstripe.png) slinks out of the gloom towards you, her amber eyes bright in the darkness. She mrowls low, her tone and posture not threatening, and yet you feel a chill run down your spine, and your fur stands on end. "Greetings, my champion," she mews, coming within a tail's length of you, eyes boring into yours, "I am Amberstripe, She of Many Lives. And I have come to help you fulfill your destiny."

She offers Marblepaw her dark gift: the power to live many lives, and to give life to others. To accept, she must let Amberstripe tear out her throat. This dark gift allows her to  cast the *[reincarnate](/dnd/spell/Reincarnate)* spell. Alternately, her body will reincarnate upon death. This power can only activate or be activated once per day. Any stages of corruption received from this or any other dark gift are preserved each time a creature is reincarnated.

***Corruption Effects***

* **Stage 1.** The creature gains a +3 bonus to its Dexterity score and the flaw: "I have little sense of self - it's hard to remember who I am or where I'm going." Its teeth become long, sharp, and pointed, and its eyes glow a pale yellow.

Ethel is drawn to West Sarcophagus, containing Great Taar Haak, the Five-Headed Destroyer.

> Before you stretches a [desolate wasteland](^curse_of_strahd/lava_wasteland.jpg) of mountainous canyons, ridges, and chasms that bubble with streams and geysers of lava. A great river of molten rock cuts through the earth nearby, its surface churning with melting black stone and spouts of hot magma. The river flows into a large lake of lava, framed by a semicircle of five great mountains that tower above the rest.
>
> Rising from the lake of lava is [an immense, five-headed hydra of dark platinum scales](^curse_of_strahd/taar_haak.jpg), each maw wide enough to devour an entire village. As one, all the maws speak in a voice like thunder that nearly knocks you off your feet. "I am Great Taar Haak, the Five-Headed Destroyer. Welcome to my abode, my champion!"

It offers Ethel its dark gift: the power of great physical strength. To accept, Ethel must wade into the lake of lava and be baptised beneath the hydra's monstrous claw. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the ability to increase its Strength score to 26 as an action for one hour up to three times per day.
