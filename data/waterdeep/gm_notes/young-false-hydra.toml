***Ambusher.*** In the first round of a combat, the young false hydra has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.

***Surprise Attack.*** If the young false hydra surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) damage from the attack.

***Multiple Heads.*** The young false hydra has four heads. While it has more than one head, the young false hydra has advantage on saving throws against being [[[general:conditions#blinded|blinded]]], [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]], [[[general:conditions#deafened|deafened]]], frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the young false hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the young false hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows a head for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has regrown 8 heads. The young false hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.

***Reactive Heads.*** For each head the young false hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
"""
actions = """!
***Multiattack.*** The young false hydra can make as many bite attacks as it has heads. Any one head can begin or continue using the Sightless Song ability.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit 9 (1d10+4) piercing damage

***Sightless Song.*** The young false hydra emits a horrible, nightmarish howl to all creatures within 1 mile. Any humanoid that can hear this song is incapable of noticing the young false hydra while it hears it. Humanoids under the effect of the song do not realize they can hear the song. The young false hydra can continue to sing the song for as long as it wants, but must stop singing if it makes a Bite attack.
