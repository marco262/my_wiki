***False Appearance.*** While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.

***Grasping Tendrils.*** The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a {@dc 15} Strength check against it.

***Spider Climb.*** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
"""
actions = """!
***Multiattack.*** The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d8 + 4}) piercing damage.

***Tendril.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. {@h}The target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 15}). Until the grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tendril on another target.

***Reel.*** The roper pulls each creature {@condition grappled} by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.
