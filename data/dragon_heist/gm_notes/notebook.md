  * Tomassin is spying on the City Watch for Emir (goings on of the Black Network, etc)
* Looking for a mentor for Brendaniel. Ulkoria will find a Draconic Sorcerer to tutor Brendaniel
* Meeting up with the doppelgangers and offering them a "look like us and draw the XG's fire" challenge
* Waiting for Renaer to come back with news about his father's symbol
* Seeking out info about the Pink Flumph theater:
  * Sewer plans?

* Uncle David will threaten Emir when he's coming back with the treasure if he doesn't take the treasure back to his family
  * He wishes to confront Golorr itself, for... reasons?

## Things to bring up to the players

* They may not have a scholars' knowledge of doppelgangers, but they do know a scholar of monsters.
* When the dragon is mentioned, ask for a History check DC 15.
  * Ahghairon was Waterdeep's first Open Lord, and his tower still stands in the Southwest corner of the Castle Ward.
  * In the mid-11th century DR, Ranressa Shiard returned as a hero from her journeys to Waterdeep atop the mighty copper dragon Galadaeros. Although she was welcomed home, the appearance of her mount flying over the city unsettled the majority of the populace. Ahghairon lead a ritual to create *Ahghaiton's dragonward* to allay their fears.
  * The dragonward is centered on [Ahghairon's tower](^ahghairons_tower.jpg), and encompasses all of Waterdeep, as far as anyone knows.
