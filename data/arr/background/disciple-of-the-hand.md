## Disciple of the Hand
You are a member of the intranational artisans' guild, the Disciples of the Hand. You are skilled in a particular field, closely associated with other artisans, and well-established in the mercantile world. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan under the sponsorship of the Hand, and you can't wait until you can become a master in your own right. For now, you are a journeyman, and you are expected to, well, *journey*, and learn more skills from other craftsmen around Eorzea.

* **Skill Proficiencies:** Perception, Speechcraft
* **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
* **Languages:** One of your choice
* **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.

### Guild Business
The Disciples of the Hand is a loose network of artisans who work all over Eorzea, and their talents range far and wide. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

As a member of your guild, you know the skills needed to create finished items from raw materials (reflected in your proficiency with a certain kind of artisan's tools), as well as the principles of trade and good business practices. The question now is whether you take on the extra effort to weave adventuring and trade together.

### Feature: Guild Membership
As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a Hand guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

### Suggested Characteristics
Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world — until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.
