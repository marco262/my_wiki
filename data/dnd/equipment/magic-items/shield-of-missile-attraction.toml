description = "<p>While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.</p><p><strong>Curse.</strong> This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.</p>"
