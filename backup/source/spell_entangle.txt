description: "Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting form a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [[[general:adventuring#difficult-terrain|difficult terrain]]].\n\nA creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away."
