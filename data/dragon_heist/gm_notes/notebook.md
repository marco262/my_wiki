## Available Plot Hooks

* Go talk to Halgraek Barrelshoulder to get troll skull
  * He wants either 500 gp or help with sabotaging his neighbor who has a nicer house than him
* Doom Raiders Mission, "On Dasher"
* Harpers Mission, "Welcome to the Family"
* Tommassin asks after Emir, clearly smitten
* Ulkoria Stonemarrow answers the call for someone to cast wards on the inn
* Response to Emir's letter from Uncle David: "Your letter was well-received, but you still have a ways to go to re-earn your family's good favor. (Including his symbol with his signature)"
* Grinda Garloth received the message about her rat familiar going missing and her family crypt robbed. Will send an animal messenger to send a message back to the party, offering them 100gp if they find where her family's bodies were taken.

---

* Uncle David will threaten Emir when he's coming back with the treasure if he doesn't take the treasure back to his family

## TODO
