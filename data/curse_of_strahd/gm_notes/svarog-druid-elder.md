**If Svarog is in combat during the ritual...**

Should the PCs attack while he is overseeing the ritual, Svarog begins combat by casting _Wall of Fire_ to block their approach, followed by _Plant Growth_ and _Erupting Earth_ to slow them down. Once all PCs have made it through the Wall, Svarog drops concentration on it and casts _Call Lightning_, whose damage is improved to 4d10 on a failed save due to the stormy conditions of Yester Hill, and uses his action on each subsequent turn to call down a new bolt of lightning. He prioritizes attacking any enemy magic-users, but will redirect his attention if any PC begins attacking or ascending the statue of Strahd. 

If his concentration on _Call Lightning_ is broken, Svarog casts _Moonbeam_, using his action on each subsequent turn to move it to a new enemy's space. If the druids casting the ritual are reduced to below one-half their numbers, Svarog casts _Fog Cloud_, which removes visibility for the PCs and allows the druids to refocus their efforts on the ritual. While _Fog Cloud_ is active, Svarog continues to attack enemies using _Ice Knife_ and _Infestation_. If reduced to less than one-half of his maximum hit points, and the ritual is in danger of being disrupted, Svarog casts _Gust of Wind_ in effort to keep any melee combatants from reaching the druids.

**If Svarog is in combat around the Gulthias tree...**

Svarog, Druid Elder begins combat by casting _Plant Growth_ centered on the trunk of the [Gulthias Tree](Gulthias Tree), reducing mobility for any creature that wishes to approach. He then alternates between an offensive and defensive strategy, depending on whether an enemy is currently attacking the trunk of the Gulthias Tree. If playing defensively, Svarog uses _Gust of Wind_ to push any attackers away from the tree's vulnerable trunk, and then casts _Ice Knife_ and _Infestation_ to whittle down their health. If playing offensively, Svarog casts _Call Lightning_, whose damage is improved to 4d10 on a failed save due to the stormy conditions of Yester Hill, and uses his action on each subsequent turn to call down a new bolt of lightning. 

If his concentration on _Call Lightning_ is broken, Svarog casts _Moonbeam_, using his action on each subsequent turn to move it to a new enemy's space. If reduced below one-half health, Svarog casts _Fog Cloud_, which removes visibility for any PCs, but allows the Gulthias Tree and its blindsight-endowed blights to continue attacking. While _Fog Cloud_ is active, Svarog continues to attack enemies using _Ice Knife_ and _Infestation_. If a PC climbs the trunk or otherwise approaches his cocoon, Svarog attempts to push them away by casting _Thunderwave_.
