***Multiattack.*** The treant makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 3d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** {@atk rw} {@hit 10} to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. {@h}28 ({@damage 4d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

***Animate Trees (1/Day).*** The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a {@creature treant}, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.
