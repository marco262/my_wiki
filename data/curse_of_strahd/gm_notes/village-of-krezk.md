  * She has already infiltrated his tower, and has his research notes on her
  * She's done a reading on his present state, and pulled the following cards:
      1. Charlatan. He is hidden somewhere, likely in a disguise of some kind. 
      2. Torturer. He carries with him great pain and loss (Ezmerelda already knows this).
      3. Mists. He seeks knowledge, but such knowledge is hard to come by, or hidden from him in same way.
      4. Traitor, inverted. If his disguise is uncovered, he could be in great danger.
      5. Shepherd, inverted. He travels with someone, perhaps a domesticated animal of some kind, who is his closest companion.
