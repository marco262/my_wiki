## Story

When Rek arrives at the [warehouse](^pirates/warehouse_interior_3.jpg), [Quizno](^pirates/quizno_bubblypots.png) will be having a meeting with a [duergar gang](^pirates/duergar_4.png) inside the warehouse, with his goblin henchmen hanging around and acting all menacing. It's an unfriendly meeting, as the duergar are angry that Quizno underpaid them the advance for their delivery. Hands are on weapons, and it's not looking good.

The goblins are on edge, the duergar guards are on edge, the [duergar boss](^pirates/duergar_3.png) is unhappy... and Quizno is calm. He manages to get talked into paying a higher price for the delivery. The duergar are appeased and head off, feeling like they pulled one over on the goblins. The goblins plan once the duergar are gone to just kill the duergar once they arrive with the delivery.

The meeting that night will happen in the [street in front of the warehouse](^pirates/warehouse_exterior_1.jpg), with weapons bristling and tensions high. Extra goblin thugs will be waiting hidden behind crates and in windows to ambush the duergar.

## Quick Notes

* Use warehouse from beginning of Dragon Heist
* The delivery is fine wine, bon bons, and Binge.
  * Binge is a drug that makes a person immune to pain. 
  * For 1 minute after taking it, they have the Relentless Endurance feature: They ignore the effects of going to 0 HP.
  * Every "hit" of Binge counts as an extra use of the feature.
  * While high, they have an insatiable appetite. Binge-users often will eat the bodies of the people they kill mid-fight.
  * After they come down, if they're still at negative hit points, they die.
* The delivery is intended for Gula, the Pirate Lieutenant. 
  * Searching the warehouse will reveal notes from Quizno that one of the pirate lieutenant's crew will come get the shipment.
  * The notes say it's for The Grand Gourmand.
* Have this lead into ways for them to get a boat/lead them back on the main story track.
* Make this handler a small obstacle on their way to greatness. He should be a fun power fantasy and lore dump.
* Play around with the battleground.
  * Rek should be able to fly in the warehouse. 
  * Give environmental hazards for people to mess with and cover for Salvia.
* What is the warehouse being used for? What can be looted?
  * What can be burned down?
  * Bootlegging? Moonshining?
  * Counterfeit potions? Roll on potion mishap tables! >:D
  * Have Xanner be ready to haul all the stuff away after they're done killing

  * Warehouses
  * Seedy parts of town
  * Menacing alleys (ambience)
