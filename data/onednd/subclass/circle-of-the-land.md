The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk.

### 3rd Level: Circle Spells

Your connection to nature infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult the table below that corresponds to the chosen type; you have the spells prepared there that are listed for your Druid level and lower.

### 3rd Level: Land's Aid

You can channel the power of the land itself to bolster friends and harm foes. As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

When you reach certain Druid levels, the damage and healing increase by 1d6: 10th level (3d6) and 14th level (4d6).

### 6th Level: Natural Recovery

Tapping into nature, you can conserve and recover your magical power. You can cast one of the spells of 1st-level or higher that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you're a 6th-level Druid, you can recover up to three levels worth of spell slots. You can recover a 3rd-level spell slot, a 2nd-level spell slot and a 1st-level spell slot, or three 1st-level spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### 10th Level: Nature's Ward

Your bond with the land protects you. You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you have resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature's Ward table.

### 14th Level: Nature's Sanctuary

Nature can rise up to protect you and your allies. As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot cube on ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current damage resistance of your Nature's Ward while there.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.
