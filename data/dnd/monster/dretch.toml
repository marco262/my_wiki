***Multiattack.*** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 2} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 ({@damage 2d4}) slashing damage.

***Fetid Cloud (1/Day).*** A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a {@dc 11} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} until the start of its next turn. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
