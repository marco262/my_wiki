Drakes are distant cousins of dragons, but where dragons are proud, solitary, and fiercely intelligent, drakes are social creatures closer in intelligence to a horse or a dog. Drake riders have learned how to tame these beasts, and even how to train them for combat.

You have formed a special bond with a drake, to the point of being magically connected to them. Your drake is now large enough to become your steed and well-trained enough to carry you into battle.

## Drake Rider Magic

_3rd-level Drake Rider feature_

You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Drake Rider Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

## Draconic Mount

_3rd-level Drake Rider feature_

<div class="phb-sidebar">
<p><b>Nightfury</b><p>

<p>The Nightfury is a variant drake type you can choose, with GM approval. The Nightfury has the same stats as the standard Drake Companion, but its Strength is reduced to 15 and it gains thunder resistance. At 7th level, its fly or swim speed is instead 60 ft. At 11th level, its breath weapon is a concussive blast with a 30 ft. range that does thunder damage in a 10 ft. sphere.</p>
</div>

Your drake is strong enough to enter combat with you.

The stat block for your drake is below:

[[include dnd/monster-sheet.tpl]]
width = 350px

[[/include]]

Choose a type for your drake from the Drake Types table below. Your drake gains resistance to its element type.

### Drake Types

||~ Drake Color ||~ Element Type ||~ Breath Weapon ||
|| Black || Acid || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Blue || Lightning || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Brass || Fire || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Bronze || Lightning || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Copper || Acid || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||

Whenever you gain a ranger level, your drake gains a hit die and its maximum HP increases by 1d8 + its Constitution modifier. At levels 5, 9, 13, and 17, your drake's AC, saves, skills, and attack bonus increase by 1.

Your drake acts as a Controlled mount, meaning it acts on your turn and can only take the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions, whether you're mounted on it or not.

You and your drake share an empathic link and can communicate clearly with each other, even if you don't speak the same language. Your drake is solely devoted to you and will not willingly let anyone but you ride it. It follows your commands without question and will protect you with its life if necessary.

If your drake is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your drake's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return your drake to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.

## Combat Training

_3rd-level Drake Rider feature_

While mounted on your drake, whenever you make the Attack action, you can command your drake to use its Bite attack on any creature within its reach.

## Drake Something

_7th-level Drake Rider feature_

You and your drake gain the following benefits:

* You gain resistance to your drake's element type.
* Choose one of the following: the drake gains a swimming speed of 40 feet and can breathe both air and water, or the drake's wings mature and it gains a flying speed of 40 feet. 
* The drake's bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of its element type.

## Drake Fire

_11th-level Drake Rider feature_
 
While mounted on your drake, you can use a bonus action to command it to use its breath weapon. Each creature in the breath weapon's area must make a DC 14 saving throw, taking 6d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area of the breath weapon, type of saving throw, and type of damage are determined by your drake's type, as shown in the Drake Types table.

This damage increases to 8d6 when you reach 15th level in this class.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use it again.

## Drake Something Else

_15th-level Drake Rider feature_

* The drake's bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of its element type (for a total of 2d6 extra damage).
* Your drake now regains its use of its breath weapon at the end of a short or long rest.
* When either you or the drake takes damage while you're within 30 feet of each other, you can use your reaction to give yourself or the drake resistance to that instance of damage.
