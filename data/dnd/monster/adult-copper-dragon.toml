***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}.*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

**Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 ({@damage 12d8}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
**Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.

The Adult Copper Dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Adult Copper Dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw or take 13 ({@damage 2d6 + 6}) bludgeoning damage and be knocked {@condition prone}. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
