### Ethel

* Armor Class: 14

Cursed with Lycanthropy

* Around the night of the full moon, Charisma save every hour to resist the Beast inside them.
  * 2 days before (DC 5), 1 day before (DC 10), Night of the full moon (DC 15), 1 day after (DC 10), 2 days after (DC 15)
  * If they fail, they transform into their hybrid form and go on a rampage.
  * While transformed, they can continue to make the save every hour, transforming back on a success.
  * If they choose not to resist the curse, they transform completely and cannot make saves for the rest of the night.
  * Indulging in killing/wanton destruction throughout the night can keep the Beast at bay.

## General Notes

* DON'T FORGET ABOUT WISHES
* Implement Path of the Beast only after Ethel's first transformation?

## Notes for Next Session

* Ask the players what they did with Nails' bite wound. Did they bandage it? Hide it?
* Have the players roll a d20. This is how many days into the lunar cycle they currently are.
* Let the players know that there are some heavy themes in here (e.g. suicide, torture, mental illness, abuse). What themes should be avoided?
* Ismarck is taking them to his place.
* On the way, they will see Morgantha peddling her wares.
* Ismarck will not come with the PCs when they take Ireena with them. He needs to stay and care for the Village of Barovia.
