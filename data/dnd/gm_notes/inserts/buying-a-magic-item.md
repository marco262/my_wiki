***Resolution.*** As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Or you can roll for items from any table associated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. As a further option to reflect the availability of items in your campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs in low magic campaigns.

The [Magic Item Generator](/dnd/equipment/magic_item_generator/) provides a convenient way to roll on the required tables, and also includes magic items from outside the DMG.

**Buying Magic Items**

||~ Check Total || Items Acquired ||
|| 1-5 || Roll 1d6 times on Magic Item Table A. ||
|| 6-10 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table B. ||
|| 11-15 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table C. ||
|| 16-20 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table D. ||
|| 21-25 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table E. ||
|| 26-30 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table F. ||
|| 31-35 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table G. ||
|| 36-40 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table H. ||
|| 41+ ||Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table I. ||

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll, when using the table to determine an asking price.

**Magic Item Price**

||~ Rarity ||~ Asking Price* || 
|| Common || (1d6 + 1) x 10 gp ||
|| Uncommon || 1d6 x 100 gp ||
|| Rare || 2d10 x 1,000 gp ||
|| Very rare || (1d4 + 1) x 10,000 gp ||
|| Legendary || 2d6 x 25,000 gp ||

\*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

You have final say in determining which items are for sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say.

***Complications.*** The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If you want to make things more interesting for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase Complications table or invent your own complication.

**Magic Item Purchase Complications**

|| 1 || The item is a fake, planted by an enemy.\* ||
|| 2 || The item is stolen by the party's enemies.\* ||
