A hyur cloaked in scale mail spies the tell-tale plume of dark smoke in the distance, and he readies his bow, aiming at the Paragon with deadly accuracy.

A roegadyn woman runs and leaps high into the sky, landing on the back of the enormous serpent. She cleaves the creature's head from its body with a massive swing of her sword.

The vieran ranger rushes behind a rock, calling to her companions to join her: the Primal Garuda is summoning a great blast, and the ranger knows a safe place from her winds is an advantage.

These fearless warriors stand against monsters, Primals, Paragons, and any other threats who would raise a hand against the star. Roaming far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, through the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers continue their unending journey to keep Eorzea safe.

### Deadly Hunters

Ceaselessly hunting their targets, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization — be they terrible monsters, the scourge of Primals, or even those secretive cultists, the Paragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.

Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers<br>acquire the ability to cast spells that harness the<br>Elements' power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and<br>the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with<br>deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the<br>borderlands.

### Independent Adventurers

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monstrous forces that press in from the shadows. Many rangers are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or the Lord of Levin attacks, a ranger might be the first — and possibly the last — line of defense. Still, anyone who fights in defense of the star will have to take every tool at their disposal, and for many rangers, that means working with a party, despite their stubborn streak.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, rangers in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Ranger Archetypes
You may select from the following Ranger Archetypes:

| Archetype  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Hunter  | *PHB* |
|  Monster Slayer  | *XGtE* |

### Archetype Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Archetypes to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn.

### Hunter
You have devoted your existence to hunting and destroying Primals, the summoned monstrosities of the Beastman tribes. You know that the Primals represent a deadly force that, if unchecked, could obliterate civilization as you know it. Your abilities are honed for fighting either the enormous monsters themselves or for wading through their many zealous followers.

### Monster Slayer
You are dedicated to the protection of the star from any threat, no matter whether it comes from rampaging dragons or an invading warlord. You roam the land looking for the next target to take down, and your skills are generalized to match any foe. You know the land has seen seven calamities: you are determined to keep it from becoming eight.
