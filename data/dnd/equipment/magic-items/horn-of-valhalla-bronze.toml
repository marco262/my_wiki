description = "<p>You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p><p>Four types of <em>horn of Valhalla</em> are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Horn Type</th><th>Berserkers Summoned</th><th>Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>01-40</td><td>Silver</td><td>2d4 + 2</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>41-75</td><td>Brass</td><td>3d4 + 3</td><td>Proficiency with all simple weapons</td></tr><tr><td>76-90</td><td>Bronze</td><td>4d4 + 4</td><td>Proficiency with all medium armor</td></tr><tr><td>91-00</td><td>Iron</td><td>5d4 + 5</td><td>Proficiency with all martial weapons</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.
