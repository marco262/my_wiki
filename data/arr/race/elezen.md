*What brings you to Quarrymill, adventurer? Mayhap you heard that our pact with the elementals permits hunting in this area? Do not think that gives you leave to strip the forest bare. Such freedom is only granted to those who temper their actions with restraint. Any who would do harm to the Twelveswood… well, I’m sure you have heard tales of the consequences.*

&mdash; Castellaint of the Wood Wailers

The elezen are a race divided within themselves, and their often arrogant attitudes keep the other races at an arm's reach. The Wildwood live off the lush forests, using their keen eyes to hunt and gather in the dense woods. Meanwhile, the Duskwights, due to prejudice, have a reputation for thievery and banditry in the Twelveswood. The Ishgardians have done away with the forest and founded an oligarchy and city state in Northern Eorzea.

### Elegance and Pride
Long legs, slender bodies, pointed ears, and sharp features are all marks of an elezen. The only thing rivaling their otherworldly appearance is the poise with which they carry themselves. Their tall, thin frames only differ within the race by the color of their skin. 

### Difference of Opinion
The elezen race is divided due to their pride. The Wildwood and Duskwights found they could not coexist and distanced themselves from one another. The Wildwood believe they are the true rulers of the forests in which they live and hold dominion. Meanwhile, the Duskwights, who historically made their homes in the cavern systems of the forests have rejoined the surface but are eyed with great prejudice by their Wildwood brethren. Centuries ago, a population of Wildwood elezen broke away and founded their own, more regimented city-state in the North, forming Ishgard. Ishgardians have a totally unique culture of their own, closed off from the rest of the world.

### The Woods and the North
The forest in which the Wildwood and Duskwight elezen live is the massive Black Shroud. It is brought to order by the Wildwood who protect the forest from poachers and other threats who dare encroach. Perhaps to spite their brethren, Duskwights disregard the need to protect the forest and hunt to their content. Looking to the Northern city state of Ishgard, one might see towering spires, palatial homes, and a grand cathedral hiding behind their enormous, forbidding gates.

### Honor and Vengeance
An elezen may set out on an adventure for many different reasons. An Ishgardian hungry for revenge against the dragons may set out to seek greater strength, while a Wildwood may take up arms to defend their forest home from an encroaching threat against the Black Shroud. Duskwights may set out to gain honor and riches to support their family or to prove to the world they are more than just a thief.

### Elezen Names
The Wildwood, Duskwight, and Ishgardian clans of elezen spell their names very similarly. Men's names are longer and always in *-loix, -aux, -mont,* or *-geant.* A female's name will always end in *-ne, -ette, -elle,* or *-ie.* 

Despite the similarity in their first names, the elezen tribes over time have claimed surnames for either side. These surnames will never cross clans, but only those who live within the race will know the difference.

### Elezen Traits
Your elezen character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elezen refinement.

**Alignment.** Wildwood elezen lean toward lawful alignments, be it their upbringing to protect the forest or life within the religious walls of Ishgard. Duskwights have embraced the wild way of living, leaning towards chaotic alignments and viewing laws as arbitrary rulings from a corrupt and unjust ruling body.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elezen.

**Subrace.** The elezen come from three different societies. Select one of the three subraces of Elezen. 

#### Wildwood
The Wildwood elezen have become the protectors of the forest and masters of archery, and they have learned to live off land wherever they find themselves. They keep a tight hold on their homes, defending them aggressively from intruders and ne'er-do-wells. Years of rough life in the forests of the Black Shroud has imbued them with skills to survive in nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1. 

**Fleet of Foot.** Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

**Natural Hunter.** You gain proficiency in the Survival skill.

#### Duskwight
Duskwights' ancestors made their home in the cavernous systems of the Black Shroud, and have become natural cave explorers. Their light hair and dark skin sets them apart from the Wildwood and marks them to stand out. With Gridania's rampant xenophobia, it can be hard for Duskwights to get by with anything but banditry, but they're also clever and resourceful, finding ways to get around their limitations without drawing ire. 

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

**Cave Dweller.** You gain advantage when making Stealth checks in caves or dim and dark lighting conditions.

**Darkvision.** Due to life in the caverns your eyes have adapted to help you see in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

#### Ishgardian
The elezen of Ishgard left the Twelveswood altogether over a millennium ago to found the city state of Ishgard. Living conditions in Ishgard are rough: the poor go hungry in the lower levels of the city, while the wealthy live in luxury and look down on the less fortunate riffraff. Ishgardians by and large worship Halone, the Fury, and the city-state is heavily ruled by the religious teachings of the Holy See. Most unfortunately, they have found themselves embroiled in a thousand-year war with dragons, and live an uncompromising life balancing war with strict adherence to their laws.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1.

**Conscription.** You gain proficiency with shortswords, shortbows and spears.

**Halone's Scriptures.** You gain proficiency in the Religion skill.
