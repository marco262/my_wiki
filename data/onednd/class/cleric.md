**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes -- where gods dwell -- and channel that energy to bolster people and to battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples or shrines dedicated to whatever deity or other immortal force unlocked their magical ability. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training, yet a Cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites that help them focus their minds and spirits on drawing power from the Outer Planes. Even a Cleric who declines to worship their divine benefactor might perform their benefactor's rites if doing so helps the Cleric feel connected to the immortal realms.

Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Some of the most influential high priests are incapable of harnessing divine magic, and a few of them feel threatened when a Cleric appears. Many can pray, and some mortals claim to speak for the gods. But few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

## Creating a Cleric

<div class="phb-sidebar" markdown="1">

**Multiclassing and the Cleric**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Cleric as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Cleric's primary ability, Wisdom, to take a level in this class or to take a level in another class if you are already a Cleric.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Cleric level, you gain Armor Training with the following: Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Shields.

***Spell Slots.*** Add all your Cleric levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available Spell Slots for casting Spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare Spells for each of your classes individually, referring to the Spell Slots of an individual class to determine the number and levels of the Spells you prepare for it.

***Channel Divinity.*** If you have more than one class with the Channel Divinity feature, a class's uses of the feature can be expended only on that class's Channel Divinity options.

</div>

To create a Cleric, consult the following lists, which provide Hit Points, proficiencies, and [[glossary:armor training]]. If you're making a 1st-level character, also consult the [Starting Equipment](#starting-equipment) section, and if you're using the multiclassing rules, see the [Multiclassing and the Cleric](#multiclassing-and-the-cleric) sidebar.

Then look at the Cleric table to see the class features you get at each level in this class. The descriptions of those features appear in the [Cleric Class Features](#cleric-class-features) section.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Cleric level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points per Level after 1st:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier  

#### Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma  
**Skills (choose 2):** History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, Religion  
**Weapons:** Simple Weapons  
**Tools:** None

#### Armor Training

Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields

### Starting Equipment

As a 1st-level character, you start with the following equipment, or you can forgo it and spend 110 GP on equipment of your choice.

* Chain Shirt
* Holy Symbol
* Mace
* Priest's Pack
* Shield
* 7 GP

## Cleric Class Features

As a Cleric, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified levels in this class. These features are listed on the Cleric table.

### 1st Level: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice:

**Protector.** Trained for battle, you gain Martial Weapon proficiency and [[glossary:armor training]] with Heavy Armor.  
**Thaumaturge.** You know one extra cantrip from the [Cleric spell list](/onednd/spell_list/cleric). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). 

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer, meditation, and devotion. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Cleric.

***Cantrips.*** You know three cantrips of your choice from the [Cleric spell list](/onednd/spell_list/cleric). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Guidance]]]_, _[[[spell:Sacred Flame]]]_, and _[[[spell:Thaumaturgy]]]_.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach 4th and 10th level in this class, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

***Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level.*** You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four 1st-level spells from the [Cleric spell list](/onednd/spell_list/cleric). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Bless]]]_, _[[[spell:Cure Wounds]]]_, _[[[spell:Guiding Bolt]]]_, and _[[[spell:Shield of Faith]]]_.

The number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing one or more of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell you add to the list.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Cleric spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class. 

### 2nd Level: Channel Divinity

You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create, and you gain additional effect options at higher levels in this class.

You can use Channel Divinity twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]]. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

***Divine Spark.*** As a [[glossary:Magic]] action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at them. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant (your choice) damage equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach certain Cleric levels: 7th level (2d8), 13th level (3d8), and 18th level (4d8).

***Turn Undead.*** As a [[glossary:Magic]] action, you present your Holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring Undead creatures. Each Undead within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it has the Frightened and [[glossary:Incapacitated]] conditions for 1 minute. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, you have the [[glossary:Incapacitated]] condition, or you die. 

### 3rd Level: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric [subclass](#cleric-subclasses) of your choice: Life Domain, Light Domain, Trickery Domain, or War Domain. Subclasses are detailed after this class's description. 

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Cleric level and lower.

### 4th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 5th Level: Smite Undead

You can cause your Turn Undead feature to smite the undying; whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll's total. This damage doesn't end the turn effect.

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Cleric subclass.

### 7th Level: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice:

**Divine Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack with a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant (your choice) damage.  
**Potent Spellcasting.** You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Divine cantrip.

If you get either option from another source, you use only the option you chose for this feature. 

### 8th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 9th Level: Commune

In the past, you have reached the divine source of your power through prayer. Now you can also have brief conversations; you always have the Commune spell prepared. 

### 10th Level: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a [[glossary:Magic]] action, choose any Cleric spell of 5th level or lower that doesn't require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing material components. You then can't use this feature again until you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### 12th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 14th Level: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful:

**Divine Strike.** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.  
**Potent Spellcasting.** When you cast a Divine cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier. 

### 16th Level: Ability Score Improvement 

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 17th Level: Subclass Feature 

You gain a feature from your Cleric subclass. 

### 19th Level: Ability Score Improvement 

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 20th Level: Greater Divine Intervention 

You are able to call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose _[[[spell:Wish]]]_ when you select a spell. If you do so, you can't use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 [[glossary:Long Rest|Long Rests]].

When you cast _Wish_ with this feature, you are immune to the stress caused by using _Wish_ to do something other than casting a spell.

# Cleric Subclasses

A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. 

Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, a pantheon, or a religious order. When you choose a subclass, you decide why your Cleric chose that domain.

* [Life Domain](/onednd/subclass/Life Domain)
* [Light Domain](/onednd/subclass/Light Domain)
* [Trickery Domain](/onednd/subclass/Trickery Domain)
* [War Domain](/onednd/subclass/War Domain)
