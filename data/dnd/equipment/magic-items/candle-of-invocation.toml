description = "<p>This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the _[[[spell:detect evil and good]]]_ spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Alignment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><td>3-4</td><td>Chaotic neutral</td></tr><tr><td>5-7</td><td>Chaotic good</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Neutral evil</td></tr><tr><td>10-11</td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><td>12-13</td><td>Neutral good</td></tr><tr><td>14-15</td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><td>16-17</td><td>Lawful neutral</td></tr><tr><td>18-20</td><td>Lawful good</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.</p><p>While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.</p><p>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the _[[[spell:gate]]]_ spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.</p>"
