# Campaign Synopsis

> Under raging storm clouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. Count Strahd von Zarovich stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness. Lighting splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. His once handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself. Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his ken, guests have arrived in his domain. Strahd's face forms a twisted smile, for he knows why they have come. Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle's towers, but Strahd is gone. Only the howling wind, or perhaps a lone wolf, fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner, and you are invited!

[[accordion What is Curse of Strahd?]]

Curse of Strahd is an exciting, tense, fast-paced adventure. It is a vivid exploration of classic gothic horror tropes and monsters, from werewolves to vampires, ghosts, and more. It is a true sandbox, providing players with the freedom to make their own choices and build the kind of adventure they enjoy. It is an unabashedly character-driven campaign, giving your player character an incredible chance to shine and make their mark on the story your group tells.

However, Curse of Strahd is also a brutal, stressful, and alienating experience. Your character will be trapped in a bleak, gothic land quite different from the world they know. The adventure contains several encounters and areas that will likely be far beyond your capabilities when you first encounter them. It does not provide routine or readily-available loot or magical items.

For a player who's not expecting it, Curse of Strahd can suck. Really suck. Let me put it this way: if you want the freedom to engage in combat and exploration without worrying about the potential risks, this is very possibly not the campaign for you. Likewise, if you are potentially triggered by gruesome depictions of horror or psychologically disturbing relationships, or if you prefer a D&D campaign that features only victories or setbacks (rather than the potential for outright defeat), you might want to try a different module.

Now, if you're still around, stick with me - because there are reasons to play this (excellent, engaging, incredibly memorable) campaign.

You should play Curse of Strahd if you:

* love gothic horror tropes and themes
* want to engage with a character-driven story that pushes you to develop relationships with multiple vivid NPCs and factions
* prefer roleplay, investigation, and relationship-building to combat or dungeon-delving
* enjoy setting your own goals and pursuing means of achieving them
* enjoy facing an active, powerful, and personally antagonizing villain
* want to participate in a tense, adrenaline-fueled experience that will create memories to last a lifetime

If, after reading this far, you think Curse of Strahd may be the campaign for you, awesome! You're in for a fantastic time. With that said, here are a few protips to succeeding in the course of this campaign:

* Intrepid adventurers and sadistic murderhobos don't last long in Barovia. Don't tread from the beaten path unless you have good reason to, and don't alienate or antagonize NPCs if you can avoid it. Make more friends than enemies. Don't go searching for treasure, fortune, or fame - because you will probably die a horrible death.
* Remember that you are not your character, and invest real time in developing their thoughts, personality, and motivation. Externalize failure, and use setbacks or defeat as an opportunity to explore your character's perspective and personal growth.
* Play smart. Many of the enemies in this adventure cannot be overcome easily in direct combat. Use guile, preparation, subterfuge, diplomacy, and research to achieve your goals.
* Spend time engaging with the other characters, even when not discussing plans, tactics, or objectives. Learn about their fears, their perspectives, and their experiences. Build meaningful relationships, not apathetic battle teams.
* Outside goals are hard (if not impossible) to achieve in Barovia. It's worth working with your DM to create a character driven to Barovia for some purpose that can only be fulfilled within its borders. Make sure to speak with your DM about how to shape your backstory into something that can be relevant in the world of Barovia.
* Try to remove yourself from the “XP and loot” model of progression in traditional campaigns and video games, and instead try to enjoy the narrative progression of winning allies, fulfilling objectives, and advancing the story of the campaign and player characters.
* Don't try to play an apathetic or evil player character unless you are 100% sure that you can pull it off while being a supportive team player and engaging the story like a normal PC. Seriously. You'll make this adventure a lot more difficult and unenjoyable for your DM, and you'll be cheating yourself out of a fun experience. You don't need to play a knight in shining armor, but you definitely shouldn't play a villain.
* Curse of Strahd, as-written, is full of disturbing and graphic content. If you are potentially triggered by elements of child abuse, murder, stalking, gaslighting, racism, torture, mind control, cannibalism, situations paralleling sexual assault, child death, references to stillbirth/miscarriage, abuse of those with disabilities or mental illness, animal cruelty, body horror, child abandonment, portrayals of alcoholism or drug abuse, potential incest, implied necrophilia, or suicide, speak with your DM about potentially working around or entirely avoiding these elements.

Oh - and don't Google anything related to the campaign.

The Web, after all, is dark, and full of spoilers.

Have fun!

# So You Want To Know About Vampires

## Vampires

*Note: Van Richten believes that Strahd is the Prime Vampire, the eldest of all. As such, it is unknown how much of the following information applies to Strahd, or if there are further powers and abilities Strahd possesses that other vampires do not.*

Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.

***Dark Desires.*** Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.

***Born from Death.*** Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn -- ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.

***Chained to the Grave.*** Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.

***Undead Nature.*** Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.

### Further Notes

* A vampire can walk on ceilings and walls as if they were floors.
* A vampire can't enter a Residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
* A vampire is hurt by running water and sunlight.
* A vampire can transform into a bat or a cloud of mist at will, as long as it isn't in sunlight or running water.
* A vampire magically heals its wounds if it isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from Holy Water, the vampire's magical healing is disabled for one round.
* When a vampire is killed, it will change into a misty vapor and retreat to its Resting Place. If it is in sunlight or running water, it cannot transform.
* If a wooden stake is driven into a vampire's heart while the vampire is asleep in its Resting Place, the vampire is Paralyzed until the stake is removed.
* Looking a vampire in the eyes or hearing its voice can subject you to its magical charm. A charmed person regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected, though the target isn't under the vampire's control. 
* A bite from a vampire will drain its target's blood (reducing its maximum HP). Recovering from a vampire's bite requires a long rest.

### Combat Info

* A vampire is cold and calculating, its behavior in combat marked predominantly by patience and guile. A smart vampire will not engage in a fight it knows it can't win.
* A vampire retains the abilities it had in life, and can gain more abilities during its undeath. Vampire weapon masters or mages are not unheard of.
* A vampire can command the beasts in its domain to attack for them, usually preferring bats, rats, and wolves.

## Vampire Spawn

* A vampire spawn can walk on ceilings and walls as if they were floors.
* A vampire spawn can't enter a Residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
* A vampire spawn is hurt by running water and sunlight.
* A vampire spawn magically heals its wounds if it isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire spawn takes radiant damage or damage from Holy Water, the vampire spawn's magical healing is disabled for one round.
* A bite from a vampire spawn will drain its target's blood (reducing its maximum HP). Recovering from a vampire spawn's bite requires a long rest.

### Combat Info
  
* A vampire spawn is vicious and aggressive, driven mostly by an instinctual need to feed. It will often use its ability to climb on walls and ceilings to ambush its victim, latch on, and try to drain it dry before it can fight back.
* A vampire spawn will attack with its claws. A vampire spawn's claws are especially adept at snagging targets and pulling them in, at which point it will attempt to bite its target and drain its blood.
