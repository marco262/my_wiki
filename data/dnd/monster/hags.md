Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they
resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about
these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the
wickedness in their hearts.
Faces ofEvil. Ancient beings with origins in the
Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their
withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid
moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long,
skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open
flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always
tattered and filthy.
All hags possess magical powers, and some have an
affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or
curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to
view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods,
whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.
Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways,
claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy
Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug,
Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.
Monstrous Motherhood. Hags propagate by
snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing
a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the
hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag
gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her
thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into
the spitting image of her hag mother.
Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn,
creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its
grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the
child grows up to become a horror.
Dark Bargains. Arrogant to a fault, hags believe
themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and
they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open
to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show
the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives,
hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark
creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.
Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own
downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous.
The terms of such bargains typically involve demands
to compromise principles or give up something dearespecially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the
knowledge gained through the bargain.
A Foul Nature. Hags love the macabre and festoon
their garb with dead things and accentuate their
appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They
nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce
weeping, s uppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke
disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by
disfiguring or transforming them.
This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant
extends to all aspects of a hag's life. A hag might fly in
.a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to
resemble an enormous headless body. Another might
travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept
in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary
creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones
and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims,
reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.
Dark Sorority. Hags maintain contact with each
other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it
is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag
in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide
by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their
presence before crossing into another hag's territory,
bring gifts when entering another hag's dwelling, and
break no oaths given to other hags- as long as the oath
is n't given with the fingers crossed.
Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that
the hags' rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When
confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it
amusing to string the fool along for a while before
teaching it a permanent lesson.
Dark Lairs. Hags dwell in dark and twisted
woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts,
and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape
around a hag's lair reflects the creature's
noxiousness, such that the land itself can
attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by
darkness attack passersby, while vines snake
through the undergrowth to snare and drag off
creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn
the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and
sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

## Monodrone

A monodrone can perform one simple task at a time and can relay a single message of up to forty-eight words.

## Duodrone

The blocky duodrones supervise units of monodrones and can perform up to two tasks at a time.

## Tridrone

Tridrones are shaped like inverted pyramids. They lead lesser modrons in battle.

## Quadrone

Astute combatants, quadrones serve as artillery and field officers in the regiments of modron armies.

## Pentadrone

Pentadrones oversee Mechanus's worker populace and can improvise in response to new situations.

[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]

A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. Rogue modrons don't act in accordance with Primus's wishes and directives, breaking laws, disobeying orders, and even engaging in violence. Other modrons hunt down such rogues.

A rogue modron loses the Axiomatic Mind trait and can have any alignment other than lawful neutral. Otherwise, it has the same statistics as a regular mod ron of its rank.
