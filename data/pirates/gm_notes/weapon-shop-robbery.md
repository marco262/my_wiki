Bertha and Tom just sold a bunch of weapons to the Knights of Twilight, and there's some criminals about to rob them. Azurhel plyed them with drinks to get them drunk, and is passing on the info to the rest of the team.

## Before the Robbery

* Highlight the town guard night patrol. Have two guards with lanterns talking about how scary the Knights of Twilight are.
* If they ask about patrol timing, they can hang around and watch, and figure that they have an open window of about 30 minutes where the guards will be out of earshot of the shop.

## What the Players Know

* Original robbers:
  * Halfling
  * Human, dressed like a merchant, seemed to be masterminding the whole plan 
  * Half-elf, rogue, called "Seymour"
* They have a security system, but it's "bog standard".
  * Easy for Seymour to bypass, according to the human. 
* However, the safe the money is in will have a password. 
  * Not sure what the password is, but Tom was overheard telling Bertha it's "the most important day of the year".
* Why tonight? They just sold a lot of weapons to the Knights of Twilight, so they have more money available.
* The general layout of Tom and Bertha's shop.
  * Main room, bedroom, back room. 
  * They've only seen the main room.

## What I Know

* Tom and Bertha are asleep in their bedroom. Bertha is a loud snorer, and neither of them will be awakened by simple noises.
* Mundane lock on the front door. DC 10
* Windows are glass and latched from the inside. No external locks. DC 15
* Brody likes guard animals. Add a dog?
  * Make Brody roll for the dog. Low roll, it's an aggressive dog they have to silence. High roll, he's friendly.
* Back room is an office and extra storage space.
  * Storage space has recently been cleared out, with hints of crates and boxes having recently been placed there.
  * Remainder of back room is safe, desk with papers, and a trophy/picture shelf.
* Money is locked away in a safe in the back room.
  * Locked with [Arcane Lock](/dnd/spell/Arcane Lock) (DC 25)
  * The password is "Taco Twosday"
  * Hidden around the room are hints:
    * A wedding gift, small wooden statues of Bertha and Tom, carved by a skilled artisan. Carved on the bottom is their anniversary: 20th of Kythorn.
    * Trophies from Bertha for 1st place in Everbrook's Taco Eating Competition (12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th). Doesn't say the day.
    * Letter of incorporation for when they bought the weapon shop. Dated 4th of Marpenoth.
    * On the underside of the safe is a scribbled picture of a taco.
  * Contains ~300 gp in coins and gems.
  * Also contains deed to their shop, their marriage certificate, and a [Mystery Key](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/mystery-key)
* Various weapons scattered around the shop, on racks and in cases.
  * A few weapon cases are locked.

## After the Robbery

* If things go poorly, they will have to evade town guards. Save Knights of Twilight for if they start doing REALLY bad stuff.
* What will they do with the loot?
