While wearing this eye patch, you gain these benefits:

* You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
* If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait.
* You are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts or determine whether you are lying. Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it.
