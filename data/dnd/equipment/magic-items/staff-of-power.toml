This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

***Power Strike.*** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

***Spells.*** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: _[cone of cold](/dnd/spell/cone of cold)_ (5 charges), _[fireball](/dnd/spell/fireball)_ (5th-level version, 5 charges), _[globe of invulnerability](/dnd/spell/globe of invulnerability)_ (6 charges), _[hold monster](/dnd/spell/hold monster)_ (5 charges), _[levitate](/dnd/spell/levitate)_ (2 charges), _[lightning bolt](/dnd/spell/lightning bolt)_ (5th-level version, 5 charges), _[magic missile](/dnd/spell/magic missile)_ (1 charge), _[ray of enfeeblement](/dnd/spell/ray of enfeeblement)_ (1 charge), or _[wall of force](/dnd/spell/wall of force)_ (5 charges).

***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

||~ Distance from Origin ||~ Damage ||
|| 10 ft. away or closer || 8 x the number of charges in the staff ||
|| 11 to 20 ft. away || 6 x the number of charges in the staff ||
|| 21 to 30 ft. away || 4 x the number of charges in the staff ||
