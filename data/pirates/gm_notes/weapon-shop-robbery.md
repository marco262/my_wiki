Bertha and Tom just sold a bunch of weapons to the Knights of Twilight, and there's some criminals about to rob them. Azurhel plyed them with drinks to get them drunk, and is passing on the info to the rest of the team.

## What the Players Know

* Original robbers:
  * Halfling
  * Human, dressed like a merchant, seemed to be masterminding the whole plan 
  * Half-elf, rogue, called "Seymour"
* They have a security system, but it's "bog standard".
  * Easy for Seymour to bypass, according to the human. 
* However, the safe the money is in will have a password. 
  * Not sure what the password is, but Tom was overheard telling Bertha it's "the most important day of the year".
* Why tonight? They just sold a lot of weapons to the Knights of Twilight, so they have more money available.
* The general layout of Tom and Bertha's shop.
  * Main room, bedroom, back room. 
  * They've only seen the main room.
