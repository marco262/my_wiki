**Primary Ability:** Charisma

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The touch of a dragon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the mortal Sorcerer, a churning magic that can even be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don't learn magic; the raw, roiling chaos of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect the source of that magic.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it tends to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't.

## Creating a Sorcerer

<div class="phb-sidebar" markdown="1">

**Multiclassing and the Sorcerer**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Sorcerer as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Sorcerer's primary ability, Charisma, to take a level in this class or to take a level in another class if you're already a Sorcerer.

***Spell Slots.*** Add all your Sorcerer levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots for casting spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare spells for each of your classes individually, referring to the rules of each class to determine the number of spells you prepare for it.

</div>

To create a Sorcerer, consult the following lists, which provide Hit Points, proficiencies, and [[glossary:armor training]]. If you're making a level 1 character, also consult the [Starting Equipment](#starting-equipment) section, and if you're using the multiclassing rules, see the "Multiclassing and the Sorcerer" sidebar.

Then look at the Sorcerer table to see the class features you get at each level in this class. Descriptions of those features appear in the [Sorcerer Class Features](#sorcerer-class-features) section.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per Sorcerer level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points per Level after 1st:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier

#### Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma  
**Skills (Choose 2):** Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, Religion  
**Weapons:** Simple Weapons  
**Tools:** None

#### Armor Training

None

### Starting Equipment

As a 1st-level character, you start with the following equipment, or you can forgo it and spend 50 GP on equipment of your choice.

* Arcane Focus (Crystal)
* Dagger (2)
* Dungeoneer's Pack
* Spear
* 28 GP

## Sorcerer Class Features

As a Sorcerer, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified levels in this class. These features are listed on the Sorcerer table.

### Level 1: Innate Sorcery

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with a simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

* The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
* You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See the Player's Handbook for rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Sorcerer.

***Cantrips.*** You know four cantrips of your choice from the [Sorcerer spell list](/onednd/spell_list/sorcerer). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Light]]]_, _[[[spell:Prestidigitation]]]_, _[[[spell:Shocking Grasp]]]_, and _[[[spell:Sorcerous Burst]]]_. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach levels 4 and 10 in this class, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of spells of level 1 and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the [Sorcerer spell list](/onednd/spell_list/sorcerer). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Burning Hands]]]_ and _[[[spell:Detect Magic]]]_.

The number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Sorcerer spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**Houserule: Changing Your Prepared Spells**

Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace any spells on your list with the same number of Sorcerer spells for which you have spell slots.

</div>

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with your Sorcerer features.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you cast with your Sorcerer features.

### Level 2: Font of Magic

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more Sorcery Points than the number shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent Sorcery Points when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

**Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot's level (no action required).

**Creating Spell Slots.** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher in level than 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

#### Creating Spell Slots

| Spell Slot<br>Level | Sorcery Point<br>Cost | Min. Sorcerer<br>Level |
|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------------:|
|          1          |           2           |           2            |
|          2          |           3           |           3            |
|          3          |           5           |           5            |
|          4          |           6           |           7            |
|          5          |           7           |           9            |


### Level 2: Metamagic

Because your magic flows from within you, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from the [Metamagic Options](#metamagic-options) section later in this class's description. You gain two more when you become a level 10 Sorcerer and two more when you become a level 17 Sorcerer.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know.

### Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice, listed at the end of this class description.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Sorcerer level and lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

As shown on the Sorcerer table, you gain this feature again at levels 8, 12, 16, and 19.

### Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration

When you roll Initiative or finish a [[glossary:Short Rest]] and have no Sorcery Points remaining, you regain a number of those points equal to your Sorcerer level divided by five (round down).

### Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.

In addition, if you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

### Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis

While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.

## Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Metamagic features. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

### Careful Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Distant Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell's range.

When you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

### Empowered Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

### Heightened Spell

_Cost: 2 Sorcery Points_

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on its saving throws against the spell.

### Quickened Spell

_Cost: 2 Sorcery Points_

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if you've already cast a spell of level 1 or higher on the current turn, nor can you cast a spell of level 1 or higher on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

### Seeking Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Subtle Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

### Transmuted Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.

### Twinned Spell

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell, such as _[[[spell:Charm Person]]]_ or _[[[spell:Hold Person]]]_, that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell's effective level by 1.

# Sorcerer Subclasses

A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain levels, as specified in the subclass.

* [[[subclass:Draconic Sorcery]]]
* [[[subclass:Wild Magic Sorcery]]]
* [Aberrant Sorcery](/dnd/subclass/Aberrant Mind)
* [Clockwork Sorcery](/dnd/subclass/Clockwork Soul)
