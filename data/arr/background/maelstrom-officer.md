## Maelstrom Officer
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, and learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You were a part of Limsa Lominsa's Maelstrom, a regiment of the Knights of the Barracuda, who serve under the Admiral and protect the land of Vylbrand and, when called upon, the entire nation of Eorzea with the other two Grand Companies. You've fought Imperials, witnessed the Calamity, and bled for your nation, and in return, you've earned a rank in the Company you're proud of.

### Specialty
During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:

| d8  | Specialty |

### Feature: Military Rank
You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to the Maelstrom still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

### Suggested Characteristics
The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

### Variant: Yellowjacket
Where many who serve the Maelstrom do so as a part of the national military, you have served the Yellowjackets, standing as Vylbrand's first line of defense against crime. You both direct your gaze outward at possible encroaching enemies and help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.

You might have been part of the force in Limsa Lominsa itself, protecting the common folk from honorless thieves and code-breaking rabble. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders around Western La Noscea, guarding against incursions of Sahagin invaders. You might even be one of the force patroling outside Pharos Sirius, a lighthouse that was struck down and destroyed in the Calamity but which now runs amok with voidsent and a dangeorus siren.

### Variant Feature: Watcher
Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals — especially pirates. You can easily find the local outpost of Yellowjackets or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.
