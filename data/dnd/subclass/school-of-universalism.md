Though most wizards specialize in a single school of magic, the rare and exceptionally gifted can advance their studies without losing focus on any arcane school. These wizards are known as Universalists, and can wield the forces of any arcane school with equal measure.

## Arcane Savant

Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, the amount of gold required to copy a spell into your spellbook is halved.

## Arcane Memorization

At 2nd level, choose 1 spell that you know to memorize. This spell is always prepared and does not count against your total number of spells known. You can select an additional spell to memorize at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. 

## Arcane Condensation

By 6th level, you can expend two spell slots of the same level to cast a spell of 1 level higher.

## Arcane Recitation

At 10th level, the time required to cast a spell as a ritual is reduced to 1 minute, unless the casting time of the spell is longer.

## Arcane Concentration

By 14th level, your focus is legendary. Whenever you would lose your concentration on a spell, you can instead choose to maintain your focus by expending a spell slot of a level greater or equal to the spell you are concentrating on.
