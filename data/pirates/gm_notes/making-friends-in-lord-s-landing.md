## Mention the Knights of Twilight

While the party is wandering through the town, roll on the [100 non-combat urban encounters](https://www.dndspeak.com/2021/07/100-non-combat-urban-encounters/) table. Play up the tone of the city, and have them interact with the guard if you can. The guard, or some of the NPCs, should mention the Knights of Twilight in some fashion. There should be a focus on how they're ostensibly a force for good and law in the city, but how they're a threat/headache to be around.

## Finding a Ship

> There are many, MANY ships down at [the docks](^pirates/lords_landing_docks.png). Merchant vessels, fishing vessels, cargo vessels. The most impressive vessels are the ones bearing the colors of the Knights of Twilight. These vessels vary in size, from the small and agile [sloops](^pirates/sloop.jpg), to the [frigates](^pirates/light_frigate.jpg), their hulls bristling with cannons and layered with sheets of iron. They stand out with their stark livery of black and yellow, visible in their folded sails and painted along the trim of the ships. But that is nothing compared to the enormous, [triple-masted beasts](^pirates/heavy_frigate_2.jpg) out in the harbor, too big to make it into the harbor. You can see smaller, single-sail dinghies sharing the Knights' colors both coming into the harbor and heading back out, ferrying sailors and supplies alike.

While trawling the docks, it will be impossible to miss the numerous people standing before their ships, loudly extolling the virtues of their vessels and trying to draw in passengers. If they show an interest in buying passage, introduce them to a fancily-dressed halfling by the name of [Yendan Snazzyfeet](^pirates/yendan_snazzyfeet.jpg) who's very eager to get them aboard his [caravel](^pirates/caravel.jpg). He charges standard price, but is willing to instead provide free passage if they'll stick with him and be his temporary crew and bodyguards. He'll be making some stops at the first islands (Durdes Isle, in particular) and would like their muscle along.

## The Underbelly of the City

While the party is hanging out at a skeevy place, they'll meet [Xanner Silentbrush](^pirates/xanner_silentbrush.png). If they're looking for contacts, they'll spy him drinking at the Mermaid's Kiss. If they're not looking, he'll approach them. He's an independent criminal, who's looking to dabble in being a "handler".

One way for thieves to get to know each other is for one to buy the other a drink, and offer an introduction saying they seem like "a man of many talents". Knowing this is an Intelligence check (with proficiency for anyone who's dabbled in illegal affairs on the mainland). The response is to buy the thief a drink in return, with the same compliment.

Xanner is willing to court the party and bring them in on a trial basis. He'll have a "test" task for them, picking from the following:

* Rob an upscale shop in the daytime, without getting caught (needs at least 50 gp worth of loot)
* A shopkeeper owes him money (50gp) and needs to be convinced to pay him back
* Kill a rival handler that Xanner has had issues with
* Vandalize the local guard outpost (will involve a chase and an obstacle course later)

## Introduce the Knights of Twilight

Wherever they have dinner for the night, they'll witness a Knight of Twilight get bumped into/beer spilled on them. The poor drunk bastard who did it will mouth off to the Knight at first, but will try to back down. The Knight will either kill the man, beat him up, or just physically drag him outside and toss him out of the tavern. No one will stand up to the Knight.
