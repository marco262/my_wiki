***Chilling Gaze.*** The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it.

***Cold Breath {@recharge}.*** The yeti exhales a 30-foot cone of frigid air. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw, taking 45 ({@damage 10d8}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
