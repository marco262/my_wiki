    <tr>
        <td>Adjustable&nbsp;Stilts</td>
        <td>The stilts take 1 minute to put on or remove. They increase the height of any humanoid wearing them by 2 to 5 feet. Each stilt weighs 8 pounds and is 1 foot long when fully collapsed.</td>

        <td>Backpack&nbsp;Parachute</td>
        <td>A humanoid wearing this piece of gear can deploy the parachute as a reaction while falling, or as an action otherwise. The parachute requires at least a 10-foot cube of unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesn't open fast enough to slow a fall of less than 60 feet. If it has sufficient time and space to deploy properly, the parachute allows its wearer to land without taking falling damage. Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Barking&nbsp;Box</td>
        <td>This metal cube, 6 inches on a side, has a crank on top. Using an action to wind the crank activates the box for 8 hours. While activated, the box barks whenever it detects vibrations within 15 feet of it, as long as the box and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. A switch on one side of the box sets the device to emit either a small dog's bark or a large dog's bark.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Matchless&nbsp;Pipe</td>
        <td>A switch made of flint is built into the bowl of this fine wooden smoking pipe. With a few flicks of the switch, the pipe lights itself.</td>

        <td>Hat of Disguise</td>
        <td>
            While attuned and wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the Disguise Self spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

        <td><a href="/static/img/visual_aids/bag_of_holding.jpeg">Bag of Holding</a></td>
        <td>
            <p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly <strong>2 feet in diameter</strong> at the mouth and <strong>4 feet deep</strong>. The bag can hold up to <strong>500 pounds</strong>, not exceeding a volume of <strong>64 cubic feet</strong>. The bag weighs <strong>15 pounds</strong>, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
            <p>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
            <p>Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>
