*I give you the Azim Steppe. Though I should say that this is but one small portion of it. Despite the close proximity, Domans rarely venture this far north. Most find these lands and their people strange and foreign…*

The au ra are a misunderstood people due to their physical appearance. Historically, their scaled bodies and horns led many to fear them, believing them to be descendants of dragons or demons. This fear led to hate, which gave way to violence, leaving these proud people fewer in number across much of the world. Due to their violent history, the Au Ra value their families beyond all else.

### Variable Size
Au ra are characterized by their curved horns and intricate patterning of scales across their bodies, with sleek and powerful tails extending behind. There is a striking difference in height between the males and females of the race, the men ranging from just over 6 feet tall to 7 and a half feet tall, while the women are dwarfed, rarely coming close to 6 feet tall. Their faces contain sharp features and piercing eyes. They take great pride in the majestic horns that protrude from the sides of their head, which also serve to enhance their hearing and sense of spatial perception.

### Divided By Blood
The auri creation myth tells the tale of two beings: the Dawn Father and the Dusk Mother, and both clans of au ra have beliefs about their connection to these beings. The dark-scaled Xaela are a nomadic people who believe that the blood of the Dusk Mother courses through their veins, and, likewise, the light-scaled Raen consider themselves children of the Dawn Father.

On the Azim Steppe, the traditional garb of the Xaela varies widely between their many tribes. Each tribe has a special way to adorn themselves, rife with deeper meaning. When living outside of their tribal homelands, auri tend to blend into the fashion style of the region in which they live. 

The Xaela view themselves as a free-spirited folk, who roam the lands hunting, gathering, and battling against other roaming tribes for the honor of their ancestors. The light-scaled Raen have instead decided to assimilate into Eastern society. Though they are a minority, their loyalty and service has been a great boon to the cultures they've adapted to.

### Peaks, Valleys and Plains
The auri homeland is known as Othard, a region to the far east. A majority of their homeland is dominated by the sprawling plains known as the Azim Steppe. The Xaela clans travel across this sea of grasslands in close knit tribes. The northern and western reaches of Othard are shielded with high mountain peaks and deep valleys shrouded in mist. It is from these mists that the Raen originally hailed. Today most Raen live in cosmopolitan society or hidden villages allowing them to live peaceful lives.

### For my family
An au ra may set off on an adventure for any number of reasons: a thirst of adventure, defense of their tribe, or a mission for a master could send them on their path. This could go as far as searching for lost family members, or seeking revenge for a slight against their family.

It was consideration for their families which helped define the two bloodlines of the au ra. The Xaela sought to keep their traditional ways and use power to protect their families. The Raen felt that a peaceful livelihood amongst the other races of the world was the best approach to protect their community.

### Au Ra Names
The au ra approach names in two strikingly different ways. The Xaela see many names shared across tribes, but there are as many spellings for the same name as there are tribes. Xaela take the name of their tribe as their surname. The Raen name themselves in their tongue in a way that their name carries meaning. Only those belonging to the ruling and warrior class of society legally have surnames. Although commoners may take a surname, it is not legally recognized. Raen who are in power often take surnames related to their feats in battle, while commoners take names related to their profession. Those from outside the Hingan culture tend to use names common in their home region.

### Au Ra Traits
Your au ra character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of auri nature.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 2.

**Age.** Despite their extraordinary physical features, the au ra live about as long as any of the other races of Eorzea, reaching physical maturity around the age of 16, and living to be around 80 years old. 

**Alignment.** The au ra as a whole do not tend towards good nor evil, nor towards law nor chaos. The Xaela tend strongly toward the chaotic lives of nomads outside the laws of civilized city states, while the Raen enjoy the order provided by the law. Most of the time, however, an Au Ra is the product of their upbringing.

**Size.** There is a large size disparity between men and women of the au ra. Males range anywhere from 6 and a half to 7 feet tall with a lean build dwarfing the females who rarely grow taller than 5 feet. Your size is medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Tribal Trance.** Au ra don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

#### Xaela
Growing up as a part of your nomadic tribe, life on the road has hardened you. A life of hunting and warring has led you to martial prowess and improved strength. You are more outgoing than your Raen counterparts and are much more willing to engage in battle to resolve a conflict. Xaela tribes are small but numerous, battling for territory against one another on the Azim Steppe. Despite a willingness to fight, Xaela do not seek war: it is merely a tool to settle differences.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1. 

**Primal Battleshout.** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
