***Crafting Items.*** You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment to make an item. The following table provides some examples.

||~ Proficiency ||~ Items ||
|| Herbalism kit || Antitoxin, potion of healing ||
|| Leatherworker's tools || Leather armor, boots ||
|| Smith's tools || Armor, weapons ||
|| Weaver's tools || Cloaks, robes ||

***Crafting Magic Items.*** The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

**Magic Item Ingredients**

||~ Item Rarity ||~ CR Range ||
|| Common || 1-3 ||
|| Uncommon || 4-8 ||
|| Rare || 9-12 ||
|| Very rare || 13-18 ||
|| Legendary || 19+ ||

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating _mariner's armor_ might require the essence of a water weird. Crafting a _staff of charming_ might require the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a _staff of power_ might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic -- a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.

***Complications.*** Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, a re linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.
