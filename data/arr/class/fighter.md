A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.

An elezen stands before a ferocious beast, his blade lit with the fire of magic. As the beast charges, he whirls and slashes his weapon with panache &mdash; and the beast slumps, cleaved in twain.

A young lalafell stands before her party, all of them winded and beaten. She wipes the sweat and blood from her eyes and forces herself to stand tall. She speaks to her party from her heart, raising her sword in strength. Her party slowly straightens as well, heartened, ready to try again.

All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in Eorzea. Questing adventurers, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings — as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

### Well-Rounded Specialists
Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior<br>combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Trained for Danger
Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or<br>the Grand Companies is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards — few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, Fighters in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Martial Archetypes
You may select from the following Martial Archetypes:

| Archetype  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Arcane Archer  | *XGtE* |
|  Banneret  | *SCAG* |
|  Battle Master  | *PHB* |
|  Champion  | *PHB* |
|  Eldritch Knight  | *PHB* |

### Archetype Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Archetypes to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn. Any Archetypes that are in the chart above but not listed below are essentially unchanged in their theming.

#### Arcane Archer
Arcane Archers are an offshoot of bards, channeling aether through magic instead of music. They work closely with the bards in matters of war, and often aid the Gods' Quiver in the Twelveswood.

#### Banneret
Bannerets are few and far between, but there are<br>just some warriors out there who can inspire even<br>the most miserable wretch to greatness. It is by a<br>Banneret's enthusiasm and dedication that another can stay fighting in an otherwise hopeless slog — and still hope to find victory at the other end.

#### Eldritch Knight
Considered one of the disciplines of the Red Mage, Eldritch Knights have drawn on a multitude of techniques across the world, mixing black and white magic along with focused swordplay and style. All of these abilities have combined in this alluring mix of talent and flair, creating a hero worthy of legend. Unlike their Bladesinger counterparts in Wizardry or the Arcane Tricksters in more Roguish pursuits, knightly Red Mages have put extra focus on their martial prowess.

For their 3rd level ability **Weapon Bond**, the following changes are made, for flavor:

You have created from your aether an **arcane accelerator**. This takes the form of a floating crystal always within your space. By using your arcane accelerator, you are able to condense your personal aether into spells, and to empower your martial attacks with your Bonded Weapons.
