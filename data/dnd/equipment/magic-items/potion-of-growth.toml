description = "<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the &quot;enlarge&quot; effect of the <em>enlarge/reduce</em> spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p>"
