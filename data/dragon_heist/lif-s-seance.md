## Medium

The medium that Volo calls on will be **Madame Lovitt von Karma**. She's who Volo was interviewing for his book "Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters". He called upon her help to perform a seance and possibly an exorcism, in return for taking her out to dinner.

However, Madame Lovitt has decided to send her apprentice **Anne Gable** in her stead. Anne is a teenager, and although she has some talents for handling spirits, she's still VERY green. Anne is very friendly, gregarious, and talks with a country drawl. She thinks that the party hired her to do an exorcism, but doesn't argue when corrected. She frequently forgets the steps of the seance and has to refer to the notes she has scrawled on her forearm under her sleeve.

## Seance

Anne will have the party choose where they want to have the seance. She can't remember if a location with a strong connection to the spirit is a good thing (better communication) or bad (more dangerous). If they choose a place with a very strong connection, the following experience will be intense and personal. If they choose a place with a weak connection, they will witness the following as if from a distance.

Ask the players what they wish to ask Lif. They'll likely say things like "What's your name?" or "What can we do to help?" or "What happened to you?"

If they don't ask a clear question that can lead to visions, have Volo or Anne drop the question instead.
 
### The Summoning

Candles are lit and everyone joins hands around a table. Anne explains that the purpose of a seance is not just to contact a spirit, but to feed it power so that it can manifest enough to communicate with them. She asks anyone willing to offer some of their life force to the spirit (1d6 necrotic damage). Doing so feels like someone is sapping their energy from them, and it feels harder to breathe and like their limbs are heavier.

When Lif is summoned, the first thing they notice is that the room grows cold enough for the PCs to see their breath. Candles anywhere but the immediate area are snuffed out, and everything outside the PC's circle seems to be plunged into darkness as they feel like the world is receding away from them.

### The Whispers

Whispers grow in volume, seeming to come from the darkness all around them. 

* "Failure"
* "Stupid knife-ears"
* "Undrinkable swill"
* "... shut down before the harvest moon..."
* "... no son of mine..."

### The Visions

As the Whispers grow and get louder and more overwhelming, each PC can feel an outside force trying to impose its will on their minds. Will they let it in? Anyone who says "No" must roll a Charisma save. Anyone who succeeds watches the other characters at the table seem to go into a trance.

For everyone else, they witness visions. They don't hear any words but they can feel Lif's emotions. If the connection to the spirit is strong, the PCs experience this as if they ARE Lif; narrate in second-person.

#### 1

You stand before a human and an elf. Though you do not recognize them, you know they are your mother and your father. Your mother, the human, is crying in dismay, beating her chest even as she avoids looking at you. The elf, your father, is furious and yelling at you, how you're a damned fool and you'll fail this, like you've failed everything else. You're yelling back, and though you can't hear the words coming out of your mouth, you know you're angry, but also determined to prove him wrong.

#### 2

You're standing in the middle of Trollskull Manor, admiring your hard work newly refurbished. A troll's skull hangs above the front door, and colorful tapestries line the walls of the main tavern, each depicting some kind of elven hero or folk tale. The mirror behind the bar is clean and whole, and you see yourself smiling back (show picture of Lif). Your shoulders ache, your hands are sore, and your body is exhausted... But you're happy. You feel pride for the first time in your life and possibly, if you dare, even a little hope.

#### 3

You're being slammed against a wall by a bugbear, while a duergar with a ten-spoked wheel tattooed around one eye demands protection money from you. You spit in the face of the bugbear, who snarls and punches you in the stomach before dropping you on the ground, where you curl up in pain, barely able to breathe. He and the duergar leave, throwing threats over their shoulder at you. As you lose consciousness, you're angry, but you're also more determined than ever. You WILL succeed.

#### 4

You're running downstairs in the middle of the night, pointing a crossbow ahead of you as you sprint through the alley behind Trollskull Manor. You burst through the back door in time to see a kenku, a human, and a halfling leap out the broken front window. You fire a bolt, but you miss as they disappear into the night. 

#### 5

Letting the point of your crossbow fall, you turn to survey the damage done, and the bottom drops out of your stomach. The tapestries are destroyed, all the kegs and bottles smashes, the mirror broken, the troll skull stolen, and slurs against are elves carved into the walls and tables. That pride that's been keeping you going these long weeks is starting to fray, and you feel helpless and alone for the first time since you arrived.

#### 6

You're standing behind the bar in your empty tavern, watching the front door, waiting for it to open. You can see people walking by outside through the hastily mended window. Some look at the tavern and shake their heads in disgust, while others avert their eyes in fear, walking faster. The pit in your stomach gnaws at you, the insults and threats echoing in your mind. You look down at the whiskey bottle by your hand, staring for a long moment before you pick it up and pour yourself a shot. Just one drink, to take the edge off...

#### 7

You're sitting in darkness, slumped against a wall. Bottles of wine and booze are scattered all around you, their glassy bodies like ghosts in the dark. Your vision is fuzzy, and your body feels heavy. You try to lift a bottle to your lips, but your hand fails you and the wine spills on yourself and the floor, mixing with the vomit already there as the bottle tumbles away. Your arms fall limp as you fight to keep your eyes open, but they're closing against your will. For the past month you've felt nothing but shame, helplessness, and despair. And as your eyes close for the last time, you feel... acceptance.

### Waking Up

After the final vision, everyone awakes to find the candles on the table have blown out, and the tavern is completely dark save for the moonlight filtering in through the dirty windows. Everyone's faces are wet with tears, though they don't remember crying.

Anne wipes at her eyes, trying to appear professional and stoic, though her voice wavers with emotion. Volo is fighting the urge to break down crying himself, and doesn't offer much.

The seance has taken a lot of energy from Lif, and he isn't able to offer many answers for the PCs should they have questions. However, if they ask him his name, they hear a thump from the library upstairs. When they go up there, they find a diary has fallen off the bookshelf, laying open on the ground.

## Tasks

(Shamelessly stolen from <https://www.reddit.com/r/WaterdeepDragonHeist/comments/9hpi1c/putting_lif_the_poltergeist_to_rest_a_checklist/>)

The visions should give the PCs some ideas on things they can do to help win over Lif:

* Troll skull above the door
* Tapestries or art of elven heroes/legends
* Repairing the mirror behind the bar

If the players need hints on what task they can do next to appease Lif, they can get hints in dreams.

When the tavern is completely fixed up and the players have otherwise won Lif over, they'll get a dream of the closet in the spare bedroom opening. When they go to investigate, they'll find Lif's tattered skeleton slumped against the wall of the closet, surrounded by bottles. When they put Lif's body to rest, he'll become a solid ally.
