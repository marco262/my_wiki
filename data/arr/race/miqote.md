*The Nunh that I once fought also believed that his strength would save him. He was wrong, and I am now Nunh. Many years ago I joined the Company of Heroes to hone my skills instead of challenging my predecessor before I was ready. Even when I was young I understood that victory goes to the patient, the cunning, the pragmatic.*

&mdash; U'odh Nunh, leader of the Drake Tribe

The miqo'te are an aloof people who value their independence from the world. Centuries ago, the miqo'te migrated to Eorzea across a bridge of ice. Seekers spreading their sparse numbers across the country to all kinds of places, while Keepers kept to dense forests as their new home. Traditionally they have avoided the other races, but over time, more and more miqo'te have integrated into society with pockets of die-hard traditional miqo'te tribes surviving in isolation.

### Lithe Hunters
The miqo'te are a feline race with large catlike ears, fanged teeth, and long tails. They have a highly tuned sense of smell and powerful legs, which have allowed them to become natural hunters. The Seekers of the Sun's ears are wider with thicker fur, while the Keepers of the Moon's ears are longer and stylized, with shorter fur. Furthermore, the eyes of the Seekers has developed slitted pupils to help guard their eyes from the exposure of the sun, while the Keepers' pupils have become large and rounded.

### Of Suns and Moons
The miqo'te are roughly divided into two clans: the diurnal Seekers of the Sun, and the nocturnal Keepers of the Moon. The former hunt during the light of day, while the latter prowl at night, and it is believed this stark difference in habit arose due to unique physical differences between the two. Furthermore, within each clan exist numerous tribes, each with their own unique culture, customs, and hunting methods - it can hardly be said that all miqo'te of the same clan share a common set of beliefs.

It is said, however, that their names are derived in part from the deities they worship: the Seekers worship the goddess of the sun, Azeyma, while the Keepers worship Menphina, goddess of the moon.

### Arid Sands and Dense Woods
Seekers can be found anywhere across the world, barring cold regions with a harsh winter climate. Those who integrate into larger cities tend to discard their tribal ties and take up the social norms of the city in which they live. Their most famous tribes live within the desert of Southern Thanalan and the harsh mountainous climes of Gyr Abania.

Keepers of the Moon, meanwhile, have taken to the dense forests away from the heat of the sun. Their most famous tribes live within the Twelveswood alongside the Wildwood elezen, clashing over the Keepers' poaching.

### Adventure Calls
The miqo'te tend to differ on their approach to life depending on their ethnicity. The Seekers of the Sun are bold individuals who are quick to jump into action, but also become bored easily. This natural need for excitement may call a miqo'te to action, leading them out into the world to explore. Those from traditional tribes may leave their tribe seeking to start their own clan, and become the alpha of their group. 

Keepers are guarded and brooding, which may stall them from setting out on a journey; however, when the need arises to protect family, friends, or their home, a Keeper will stop at nothing to protect that which they cherish.

### Miqo'te Names
Male Seekers of the Sun do not take a family name, but instead are given the surname Tia at birth. A Tia may change their surname to Nunh by challenging the tribe's chief and defeating him in battle. A female Seeker's surname is the first name of the male who sired her. 

In addition, a Seeker's first name is formally preceded by a letter which is associated with their tribe. The tribal prefix often gets dropped in casual conversation with close friends and family.

The female Keepers go without a tribal prefix due to their small communities. Additionally in their culture the mother's surname is passed on to the children. The males born into the Keepers' communities take both of their mother's names, adding a suffix to the end of their first name to indicate their birth order counting the males.
