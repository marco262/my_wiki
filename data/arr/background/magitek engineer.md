The Magitek Academy serves as both a research facility and a school for engineers. You are one of the alumni, whereby only a handful of outstanding applicants are admitted into, or even graduate from, the institution's program. Research. Knowledge. Progress - For the glory of Garlemald.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** *Special.* Investigation. If you are already proficient, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
- **Languages:** Garlean
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Engineers’ kit and vehicles (magitek)
- **Equipment:** A set of imperial (red) or ironworks (blue) work clothes, an engineers’ kit, a pair of welding goggles, a container of ceruleum, and a pouch containing 500 gil

## Specialization
Choose from the table, or roll a d4 to determine your engineering specialization.

| d4  | I know everything about...           |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------|
|  1  | Aerial vehicles and constructs.      |
|  2  | Equipment and personnel items.       | 
|  3  | Infrastructure and systems.          |
|  4  | Terrestrial vehicles and constructs. |

## Feature: Architectus
You are assigned the rank of ***jen***, which is officially recognized within Garlemald and Her territories.

With your tenure at the Magitek Academy, you possess specialized knowledge on a range of magitek devices including objects, vehicles, and constructs. Outside of combat, if a particular piece of magitek correlates with your specialization, this knowledge is second nature to you and does not require a skill check.

## Optional Feature Extension
At your DM's determination, you may begin the campaign at a higher rank, or be eligible for promotion. The following lists those ranks succeeding ***jen***, in descending order.
- ***kir:*** Architectus veteranus, a veteran field engineer.
- ***lux:*** Architectus ordinum, commander of a small unit of field engineers.
- ***mal:*** Praefectus architectorum, high commander of field engineers.
- ***nan:*** Primus architectus, a chief engineer.

Imperial forces recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other engineers and requisition equipment, befitting your rank, for temporary use.

## Suggested Characteristics
Magitek engineers are by nature, an inquisitive and curious breed. They are often fiercely intelligent but their methods tend to border on the reckless and unorthodox when all else fails. Their alignment is typically governed by their personal opinions on how magitek should be used, rather than whether they're Garlean-born or an Eorzean "savage."

|  6  | I see little value in gil, unless it's to purchase knowledge like books or Allagan tomestones. |

|  5  | **War.** I measure success based on the amount of wanton destruction my projects cause. (Chaotic) |
|  6  | **Innovation.** Every minute improvement brings the realm one step closer to advancement. (Any)   |

|  6  | We'll know the device exploded because we will realize that we aren't alive anymore. Perfect logic - start 'er up. |

## Variant Engineer: Ironworks Employee
The talented engineers of the Garlond Ironworks labor tirelessly to advance the realm with the introduction of magitek technology to the peoples of Eorzea. If you decide that you are an Eorzean engineer, you must choose the **Freedom Through Technology** feature below instead of the Architectus feature.

## Variant Feature: Freedom Through Technology
Using the **crafting an item** rules as described in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything,* and with use of an engineers' kit, you are able to take a nonmagical object, piece of gear, or item, and convert it into a magitek iteration of itself. Work with your DM to determine the nature and extent of the innovation that the conversion grants. For example:

- A speaking trumpet can be powered to allow the user to project their voice further.
- A kettle can be converted to heat itself, no longer requiring fire or a stove.
- A fishing rod can be modified reel itself in once a bite is detected.
