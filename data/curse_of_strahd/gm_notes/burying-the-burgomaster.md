As per tradition of the Morninglord, the burial rites must be performed all night, and the body is buried in the graveyard at first light. The body is taken into a side room, where Donavich (and probably Ireena) stay all night.

At midnight, a knock sounds at the church doors. Ismark warns the players not to answer it. 

After the third round of knocks go unanswered, there's a powerful gust of wind completely throwing the doors wide open and smashing the barricade. The sudden squall extinguishes the candlelight plunging the church into darkness. The wind continues until Ismark and a PC force their way against the wind (DC 10 Strength Check) and close the doors.

Once the doors are closed, the candles spring back to life and [Strahd](^curse_of_strahd/strahd_3.jpg) is sitting on the altar. "Am I too late to pay my respects?"

**If Ireena is in sight**

Strahd will talk to Ireena as an old friend, and ask Ireena to introduce him to her friends. When she refuses, his cordiality will turn cold and he'll glower at her, crooking a finger. She'll straighten, eyes go blank, and she'll haltingly start to approach him. If the PCs attack him, [zombies](^curse_of_strahd/strahd_zombie.jpg) [[stats]](Strahd Zombie) will start smashing the boards out of the windows, beat down the door, and try to swarm the party. 

At a narratively appropriate time, Strahd will feck off, saying something about how he looks forward to their next meeting.

**If Ireena is hidden** 

Strahd chats with the party, pretends this is the first time he's seen them, and talks about "all the fun they'll have together". He's unconcerned that the PCs will manage to successfully protect Ireena from him. 

Eventually, he departs as a blood-red mist, his laughter echoing the whole time.

Once his laughter dies away, there's pounding at the door as [zombies](^curse_of_strahd/strahd_zombie.jpg) [[stats]](Strahd Zombie) try to get in.
