As you hit the target, your strike flares with white-hot intensity, and the target takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage from the attack and ignites with magical fire. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target takes 1d6 Fire damage and then must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell continues. On a successful save, the spell ends.
