## Landmark A: Barovian Farms

[1](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark A - Barovian Farms.jpg), [2](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark A - Farmland.jpg), [3](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark A - Farms.jpg), [scarecrow](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark A - Scarecrow.png) 

These six farms spread out across much of the Barovian Basin, growing grains and root vegetables that are then carried in heavily-guarded merchant caravans to Vallaki.

## Landmark B: Old Gravesite

[1](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark B - Grave Site.jpg) 

This small collection of graves mark a Barovian farming family that died of a supernatural plague in the night. Their residence, thought cursed by the locals, lies crumbling nearby.

## Landmark C: Ankheg Nest

This nest houses a pair of mated ankheg that recently killed a band of adventurers. For more information, see [Last Week's Meat](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12NXx2gqbEUNlpf2FNqn3pHIptltn1w6k37ZbIh_My88/view#heading=h.xv43t4ajd96v) here.

## Landmark D: Raven's Roost

[1](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark D - Ravens Roost.jpg)

A swarm of ravens can always be found nestled in the gnarled branches of this large dead tree. If listened to using the _[speak with animals](/dnd/spell/speak with animals)_, the ravens can be heard gossiping about recent events in Barovia, as well as recent events at the Wizard of Wines. If she is with the PCs, Ireena warns the party that to kill a raven is considered bad luck.

## Landmark E: Crumbling Chapel

[1](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark E-Q - Stonegarden.png)

This old shrine bears two altars: one to the Morninglord, and one to Mother Night. The Morninglord's fine wooden altar has decayed over time, leaving its carved sunburst barely visible. Mother Night's stone altar still bears the mark of her crescent moon, but moss and fungi have overgrown her side of the sanctum, cracking and crumbling the floor.

## Landmark F: Ancient Watchtower

[1](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark F - Ancient Watchtower full.jpg), [2](^curse_of_strahd/landmarks/Landmark F - Ancient Watchtower.jpg)

This ancient watchtower is all that remains of a ruined fort used by the forces of Delmor during Strahd's invasion. It stands above a flat, grassy yard scattered with rusted armor and old bones. The tower was stormed by Strahd's forces long ago, and contains at its peak a brass spyglass. A person that looks through the spyglass sees the world suffering beneath a terrible storm, and sees only ghostly images when viewing characters non-native to Barovia. A character that dies and is resurrected in Barovia appears solid to the spyglass thereafter. A character that lingers in this tower can hear the whistling of wind and the far-away sound of marching troops, both of which soon fade.

The watchtower is a safe place to take a short rest.
