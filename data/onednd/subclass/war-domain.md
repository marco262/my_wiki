War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.

Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

### 3rd Level: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the War Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### 3rd Level: War Priest

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of one kind of Simple or Martial weapon with which you have proficiency. Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can change the kind of weapon you chose to another eligible kind.

In addition, you can make one weapon attack as a Bonus Action. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short Rest or [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### 3rd Level: Guided Strike

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you misses with an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to expend one use of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus, potentially causing it to hit.

### 6th Level: War God's Blessing

Whenever you cast _[[[spell:Shield of Faith]]]_ on another creature, the spell also affects you.

In addition, you can cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Short Rest or [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### 17th Level: Avatar of Battle

You gain resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
