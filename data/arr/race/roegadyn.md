Adventure is in their blood.

Their faces have fierce features and large flat noses. Due to their large size, Roegadyn tend to wear durable, flexible clothing which allows them to move easily.

## Maritime Reavers, Volcanic Hermits

Be it sailing, naval service or mercenary work, the Sea Wolves continue to feel most at home when adventuring on board a ship. The Hellsguard in comparison live in land around the volcanic mountains of Abalathia. Here they guard the material plane from undead spirits trying to return home.
