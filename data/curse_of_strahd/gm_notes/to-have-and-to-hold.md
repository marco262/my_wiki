# The Vistani

If the PCs travel to Van Richten's tower after the dinner, he will not be present and will not arrive any time soon. If the PCs send a Paper Crane (very likely), he will respond with a Sending as soon as he gets it to Oren: *I am busy. Also, you are likely being watched. We will meet soon. I will Send for you when I am ready.*

Marblepaw will recommend they talk to the Vistani to ask for their favor... but maybe they can just learn about Strahd while they're there? The Vistani will welcome the party with open arms, and will happily take them in and treat them as honored guests. If they ask about Strahd's history, they'll be treated to a one-woman dance called the [Prastonata](https://old.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8a2b91/usefuloptional_fluff_collated_by_me/), accompanied by a song in the Vistani language where they will tell a story of Strahd's past as they know it. A nearby Vistani will whisper translations to them in Common as it goes on.

## Madame Eva

The Vistani don't have more info about the Amber Temple, or where it is or anything like that, just what they know from the song. But if the players insist on learning more, they are pointed to go see Madame Eva.

## What If My Party Is a Bunch Of Morons?

If the party still isn't piecing things together, have Marblepaw roll an Intelligence (History) check. She remembers when they were in Yaedrag, of the stories Elder Ormir told them of the Place of Power in the mountains, where darkness sleeps.

## Alternate Route

If the party doesn't follow the hook to the Amber Temple, or don't visit the Vistani, they will be visited by a golden eagle, which delivers the message from Elder Ormir of Yaedrag to inform them that they've witnessed one of Strahd's servants traveling through Tsolenka Pass "on a horse made of shadows", and they should come and investigate quickly if they still seek knowledge.

If the party does go to the Amber Temple, and they make a stop by [Yaedrag](Tsolenka Pass#yaedrag) on the way, the shaman will tell them all this in person.

# Meanwhile...

Strahd should send a [love letter](^curse_of_strahd/strahds_love_letter.jpg) to Ireena. It will include a gift from Volenta for Oren: [A rose made of jet black beetle carapaces](^curse_of_strahd/black_rose.jpg).

# The Amber Temple

The party will learn everything [the temple](The Amber Temple) has to offer in the module/supplement, especially that Strahd was originally given his power by the Dark Power Vampyr. Make sure to have Ireena use her Divine Eminence power several times.

Make it so that the Amber Temple proves that Strahd did not lose his soul when he was turned into a vampire. This will make it so that there's justification for the idea that Strahd is not an irredeemable monster. Helps with player buy-in to the idea that Strahd can be redeemed with Ireena's love.

(Strahd IS an irredeemable monster, but that's just who he is. He's lost his ability to empathize with people during all his centuries as a moving corpse, and he was already very cruel and horrible to start with.)

# Van Richten's Debriefing

After the PCs return from the Amber Temple, Van Richten will be waiting at his tower to talk with them. If they don't travel directly there, he will give them a Sending to tell them to meet him there. 

The PCs will talk to Van Richten, giving him a summary of their dinner with Strahd. Van Richten will be attentive, encouraging as many small, seemingly insignificant details out of them as he can. His final demeanor will not be cheered, but deeply thoughtful, staying silent for many long moments after he's out of questions.

Finally, he will share his summary of what they've told him: That he believes that Strahd is leading them on, faking vulnerability to get in their good graces. However, he is becoming slowly more convinced that Strahd's interest in Ireena is genuine, but his final goal for her is unclear. He's uncertain that Strahd would want to turn her into a consort, because turning a creature into a vampire destroys their soul and makes them a shell of their former self.

## Revelations

However, after grilling Ireena, she'll reveal that Strahd has already bitten her, which will make Van Richten deeply pensive... and his face will light up in as an idea hits him, and he insists he has to review his notes. He'll refuse to answer questions or take company for a full night, but in the morning he will share with the party his theory. 

Van Richten's theory is that, because Strahd has made his pact with a Dark Power, it means that the source of his strength can also be a weakness. Dark Powers are the antithesis to all things good, beautiful, and pure. But that means that those things are also the antithesis to the Dark Powers. And in a moment of revelation, Van Richten will reveal his theory that Strahd is trying to kill two birds with one stone: To get Ireena into his unlife, but also loosen the Dark Powers' hold on him with one weapon they can't defend against: Love. (If Marsha starts to come up with this idea, lean into it.)

He will then tell them about the Bride Ceremony, an ancient ritual he only knew through legend where a Vampire can make another Vampire without destroying the previous one's soul. He thinks this is what Strahd's final goal is, and he encourages the PCs and Ireena to go through with it. Ireena will falter, but Van Richten will push hardest on convincing the PCs to follow through with this idea, knowing they will convince Ireena.

## Van Richten's Master Plan

After this, let the PCs plot and plan amongst each other. Meanwhile, Van Richten will take Ireena aside for cleric training. During this time he will tell her that he thinks the Love Conquers All plan is doomed to failure. BUT he lets her know that the Bride Ceremony briefly bonds the vampire with their victim so tightly, that if the victim dies, the vampire itself will likely die as well. So he convinces her that, after the Ceremony is complete, she should stab herself with a hidden knife and use her Divine Eminence on her newly-undead body, killing her self and hopefully killing Strahd. 

Ireena will be horrified but agree, as Van Richten leans hard into the "You're the only one who can save this land" guilt-tripping. She will not tell the PCs, and pretend she's nervous about the plan to marry Strahd.

# The Courtship

*These following sections should be moved to another page. Saving here as basic notes.*

Ireena will insist they Do Things Properly, and go through a whole Courtship with Strahd. Play along with this, encourage the PCs to get involved with planning. Use *Can You Feel The Love Tonight* or *Bella Noche* as background music at some point.

Eventually, Strahd will propose to Ireena, who will give an apparently enthusiastic Yes!

# The Ceremony

The [ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8a2b91/usefuloptional_fluff_collated_by_me/) will be held in Castle Ravenloft's chapel (be open to players insisting it happen elsewhere). Lean into wedding symbology, with Rahadin officiating. It will end with "You may now bite the bride," and Strahd biting Ireena, who will gasp in pleasure. Then Strahd will bite open his wrist and give Ireena his blood. She'll drink hungrily, both of them clearly getting a lot of sexual pleasure from it, moaning and pressing together.

Strahd will pull Ireena away, and laugh triumphantly as she recovers, staggering in place. He'll turn to the chapel and cheer his victory. "She is mine! Her body, her soul, her heart, her mind... We are as one! I can sense every--" His smile will fall, and he'll look back at Ireena, stunned as she pulls out a knife from her dress, looks Strahd in the eyes, and plunges it into her heart. She screams in pain as she channels her Divine Eminence into her body, and Strahd doubles over, screaming in return pain. The party can see her hands, the knife, and her chest glowing with sunlight.

Everyone is stunned as they watch this happen, and as suddenly the light fades. Ireena and Strahd stare at each other, her gaze distant and broken. And then she falls before him, first to her knees, before dissipating into dust before she hits the floor.

Strahd will be kneeling on the ground, clutching his chest. He tries to speak, but just coughs up dark blood, as black as ichor. He staggers to his feet, clearly severely injured. But then he'll turn his gaze full of fury at the party and scream, "KILL THEM!"

Roll initiative! The party must decide if they wish to kill Strahd while he's weakened, while every one of his minions will be charging in to try and attack the party. Strahd will be at half-health with no Heart of Sorrow shielf, and only able to attack with disadvantage. If the party does not try to kill Strahd, try to kill them first (a TPK right now would be satisfying). If they get away, Strahd will hunt them relentlessly. He won't be swayed and he can't be stopped.

Notes:

* Figure out what happens to Van Richten and Ezmerelda during all of this. If they can appear to defend the PCs in the middle of the battle, all the better.
