Your pact is rooted in magic that is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an ineffable being from the Far Realm or an elder god known only in legend -- a being such as Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great Cthulhu; or some other unfathomable and uncaring being. Or you might rely on eldritch lore invoking the names of several such entities, without yoking yourself to one in particular. The motives of these beings are incomprehensible to mortals, and their knowledge is so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets they hold. The Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence, but the secrets you have learned nevertheless allow you to draw your magic from it.

### Level 3: Patron Spells

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|:----------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        3         | _[[[spell:Detect Thoughts]]]_, _[[[spell:Dissonant Whispers]]]_, _[[[spell:Phantasmal Force]]]_, _[[[spell:Tasha's Hideous Laughter]]]_ |
|        5         | _[[[spell:Clairvoyance]]]_, _[[[spell:Hunger of Hadar]]]_                                                                               |
|        7         | _[[[spell:Confusion]]]_, _[[[spell:Evard's Black Tentacles]]]_                                                                          |
|        9         | _[[[spell:Modify Memory]]]_, _[[[spell:Telekinesis]]]_                                                                                  |

### Level 3: Awakened Mind

You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a Bonus Action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and create a telepathic bond. You and the chosen creature can speak telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must speak mentally in a language the other knows.

The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It ends early if you have the [[glossary:Incapacitated]] condition or die or if you use this feature to form a connection with a different creature.

### Level 3: Psychic Spells

When you cast a Warlock spell that deals damage, you can change its damage type to Psychic. In addition, when you cast a Warlock spell that is an Enchantment or Illusion, you can do so without verbal or somatic components.

### Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant

You learn to read the attacks of minds you touch. When you form a telepathic bond with a creature using your Awakened Mind, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you have Advantage on attack rolls against that creature for the duration of the bond.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[glossary:Short Rest]] or [[glossary:Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of it by expending a spell slot of level 2 or higher (no action required).

### Level 10: Thought Shield

Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have Resistance to Psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals Psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.

### Level 10: Eldritch Hex

Your alien patron grants you a powerful curse. You always have the _[[[spell:Hex]]]_ spell prepared. When you cast _[[[spell:Hex]]]_ and choose an ability, the target also has Disadvantage on saving throws of the chosen ability for the duration of the spell.

### Level 14: Create Thrall

Your patron grants you the ability to manifest a part of itself. You always have the _[[[spell:Summon Aberration]]]_ spell prepared. When you cast the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require Concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your _[[[spell:Hex]]]_, the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to the target equal to the bonus damage of that spell.
