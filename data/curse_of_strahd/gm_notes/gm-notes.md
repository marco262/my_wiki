# The Soulless

Inspiration: <https://old.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/aeam04/how_do_we_feel_about_the_soulless_barovians/edoinq0/>

In reality, no Barovians are born without souls. However, souls are recycled over and over, with people with similar souls looking like their previous incarnation. A soul that has been recycled a lot begins to fray, and become weaker and insubstantial. These are the "Soulless" who are given easily to despair and fear. Given a few centuries, these souls might wear out completely and disappear.

Some souls have uncommon resilience, or have not gone through many incarnations. Tatyana's soul was kept and held by Strahd, except 20-ish years ago, he lost it and it found its way into Ireena. This is why he's insistent on capturing her now, because he is certain she is the reincarnation of Tatyana.

Strahd curses any adventurer souls to never reincarnate, and are instead forced to go through the March of the Dead every night. This process wears them out faster, and their souls will wear out completely in a century or two.

# Possible Ideas

* Their Ally is Rudolph van Richten. They first encounter Esmerelda who journeys with them to find Richten. However, Strahd kills Richten. In despair, Esmerelda finally comes into her own and takes on the power Richten possessed.
  * Maybe a vampire hunter needs to learn to channel divine power of some kind? She regains her faith?
* Lord Jared is a Summer Court Fey, and so is not "welcome" in the Shadowfell where Barovia's demiplane exists
    * On his first visit, he will bring some Uncommon magic items with him as presents, and give them more instructions for other items to seek out.
    * With each item they find, he visits with more gifts of increasing rarity, to Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary.
* Lord Jared wants something from Strahd. The sunsword? The tome? The holy symbol? Something else?
* Give the party a Tarokka deck, and give Caytlin a guide on how to use it. Let her do actual "tarot" readings for the game.
* Most NPCs in Barovia are some flavor of either Neutral or Evil. Goodness died out long ago.
