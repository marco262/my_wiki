## Suggested Characteristics

A chocobo handler is responsible for caring for and providing services related to chocobos. Some are simply hobbyists, believing the birds to be the realm's most loyal and foremost companions. While the love for these cloudkin is rewarding in its own right, it can be a thankless job for some, who become vulnerable to more selfish and exploitative practices.

## Variant Handler: Tailfeather Hunter

You have chosen to brave the frontier lands of Dravania to hunt and capture wild chocobo, with only the mighty caelumtrees shielding you from the dragons in the skies.

If you decide that your career involved hunting and tracking over training, you may choose the Choco Trapper feature below instead of the Chocobokeep feature.

## Variant Feature: Choco Trapper

You can fashion a decent trap using only gysahl greens and hempen rope. You can also read much about an area just by using your knowledge of chocobo behavioral patterns. In addition to tracks, ask your DM about the presence of:

* **Barkstripping** - a sign of territorial marking, indicating the birds are more aggressive and may challenge potential threats they find.
* **Discarded downs** - signs of stress or potential danger, something in the area may be of concern.
* **Previously-hatched eggs** - indicate a breeding ground, it may be an area of relative safety.

Additionally, whenever you visit the Tailfeather settlement in Dravania, you have access to free room and board.
