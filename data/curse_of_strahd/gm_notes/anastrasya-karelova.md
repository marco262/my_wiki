***Shapechanger.*** If Anastrasya isn't in sunlight or running water, she can use her action to Polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into her true form.
While in bat form, Anastrasya can't speak, her walking speed is 5 feet, and she has a flying speed of 30 feet. Her Statistics, other than her size and speed, are unchanged. Anything she is wearing transforms with her, but nothing she is carrying does. She reverts to her true form if she dies.

While in mist form, Anastrasya can't take any Actions, speak, or manipulate Objects. She is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a Hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and she can't pass through water. She has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution Saving Throws, and she is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage she takes from sunlight.

***Regeneration.*** Anastrasya regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Anastrasya takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Anastrasya's next turn.

***Spider Climb.*** Anastrasya can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Vampire Weaknesses.*** Anastrasya has the following flaws:

* _Forbiddance._ Anastrasya can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
* _Harmed by Running Water._ Anastrasya takes 20 acid damage when she ends her turn in running water.
* _Stake to the Heart._ Anastrasya is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into her heart while she is incapacitated in her resting place.
* _Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ Anastrasya takes 20 radiant damage when she starts her turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, she has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Multiattack.*** Anastrasya makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

***Longsword.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Anastrasya, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Anastrasya regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces her hit point maximum to 0.

***Charm.*** Anastrasya targets one Humanoid she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see Anastrasya, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by Anastrasya. The charmed target regards Anastrasya as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Anastrasya's control, it takes Anastrasya's requests or Actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Anastrasya's Bite attack.

Each time Anastrasya or Anastrasya's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Anastrasya is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** Anastrasya magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Anastrasya can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Anastrasya and obeying her spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Anastrasya dies, or until Anastrasya dismisses them as a bonus action.

***Flying Longsword.*** Anastraya commands her flying longsword to perform two longsword attacks against a target she can see. +5 to hit, 1d8 + 3 slashing damage.

The diplomat of Castle Ravenloft and a former Vallakian noble, Anastrasya is as skilled with a sword as she is with her tongue -- but is sure never to get her hands dirty. Of Strahd's brides, Anastrasya is most adept with the vampiric arts.

Using powerful magic, Anastrasya telekinetically wields a longsword that gains the properties of a _[flying sword](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#flying%20sword_mm)_ that acts on her initiative. While wielded in this way by Anastrasya and within 50 feet of her, the sword has a Strength of 16 and cannot be targeted or damaged by attacks or spells, as though it were a held item. While wielding it, Anastrasya can use her bonus action to allow it to perform two longsword attacks against a target she can see using its modified Strength score. Anastrasya also telekinetically wields a shield that acts as if it were an _[animated shield](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/Animated Shield)_ while under her control.

Anastrasya is Strahd's second-eldest bride, and the foremost executor of his will among the Barovian populace. In life, she was a Vallakian noblewoman who hosted great celebrations in Strahd's honor and ruthlessly punished any who displayed traitorous intent. Enamored with the prospect of becoming his bride, she believed that if he could only see her unearthly beauty in person, he would deem her worthy of his hand in marriage.

It was at one of her events that she met Ludmilla Vilisevic, who claimed to be an agent of the count and offered an invitation to dine at Castle Ravenloft with Strahd himself. Anastrasya eagerly accepted.

Upon arriving at the castle, Ludmilla gave Anastrasya a tour of the decrepit keep, pleased with the prospect of unnerving the noblewoman with the macabre sights of Castle Ravenloft. Much to her surprise -- and Strahd's satisfaction -- Anastrasya was immediately taken with the displays of Strahd's power and darkness.

Strahd took to her immediately, and though it meant his waning interest in Ludmilla faded faster, he appreciated his elder bride's foresight in locating this new consort.

When not needed elsewhere by Strahd or resting in her coffin in Strahd's tomb, Anastrasya can most often be found in area K37 (Study).
