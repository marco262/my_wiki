**Primary Abilities:** Strength, Charisma

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

A Paladin swears to stand against corrupting influences and to hunt the forces of ruin wherever they lurk. Different Paladins focus on various aspects of these causes, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield -- power to heal the sick and injured, to smite their foes, and to protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world's armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then, their loyalty is first to their sacred oaths, not to crown and country.

Adventuring Paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or a dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Malign forces lurk in dungeons, and even the smallest victory against them can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.

## Paladin Class Features

[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]

**Multiclassing and the Paladin**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Paladin as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Paladin's primary abilities -- Strength and Charisma -- to take a level in this class or to take a level in another class if you are already a Paladin.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If Paladin isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with Martial Weapons when you take your first Paladin level.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Paladin level, you gain Armor Training with the following: Light Armor and Shields.

***Spell Slots.*** Add all your Paladin levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available Spell Slots for casting Spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare Spells for each of your classes individually, referring to the Spell Slots of an individual class to determine the number and levels of the Spells you prepare for it.

[[/div]]

As a Paladin, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified levels in this class. These features are listed on the Paladin table. 

### 1st Level: Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Magic action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

In addition, you can expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature, rather than using those points to restore Hit Points. 

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer, meditation, and devotion. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Paladin.

***Prepared Spells.*** You have the following spells prepared: _[[[spell:Heroism]]]_, _[[[spell:Resistance]]]_, _[[[spell:Spare the Dying]]]_, and _[[[spell:Thunderous Smite]]]_. Alternatively, you can prepare two 0-level spells (also known as cantrips) and two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Divine spell list.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can meditate and replace any spell you have prepared for this class with another Divine spell of the same level.

At higher levels in this class, you can prepare more spells, as shown on the Paladin table. The numbers there determine the number of different spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 4th-level Paladin, you can prepare two different 0-level spells and three different 1st-level spells.

***Spell Slots.*** When you cast a prepared Paladin spell, you expend a Spell Slot. The number of Spell Slots you have of 1st-level and higher is the same as the number of different spells you can prepare of each level, as shown on the Paladin table. For example, as a 5th-level Paladin, you have four 1st-level Spell Slots and two 2nd-level Spell Slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for your Paladin spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class. 

### 2nd Level: Divine Smite

When you strike a target, you can channel divine energy to smite it. Immediately after you hit a target with an attack roll using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend one Spell Slot to deal Radiant damage to the target. The damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level Spell Slot, plus 1d8 for each slot level higher than 1st.

You can use Divine Smite no more than once during a turn, and you can't use it on the same turn that you cast a spell. 

### 2nd Level: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess and gain the Fighting Style: Defense feat, or you gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice.

Whenever you gain a feat at later levels, Fighting Style feats are among your options, even though you aren't a member of the Warrior group. 

### 3rd Level: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create from among those you have from this class.

You can use Channel Divinity twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Paladin levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Paladin table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

***Divine Sense.*** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the _[[[spell:Hallow]]]_ spell. 

### 3rd Level: Paladin Subclass

[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]

**Breaking Your Oath**

A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated Paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a Paladin to transgress their oath.

A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a priest of the same faith or from another Paladin of the same order. The Paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.

If a Paladin willfully violates their oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences might be more serious. At the DM's discretion, an impenitent Paladin might be forced to take a more appropriate subclass or even to abandon the class and adopt another one.

[[/div]]

You gain the [[[subclass:Oath of Devotion]]] subclass or another Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath of Devotion is detailed after the Paladin's class description, and other subclasses will appear in future _Unearthed Arcana_ articles.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Paladin level and lower. This class's description tells you the levels when your subclass provides features. 

Each of this class's subclasses represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at 3rd level, is the culmination of a Paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true Paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already true in the Paladin's heart.

### 4th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 5th Level: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### 5th Level: Faithful Steed

You can easily call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the _[[[spell:Find Steed]]]_ spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare.

When you cast this spell, its casting time is an action. You can also cast the spell once without expending a Spell Slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Paladin subclass. 

### 7th Level: Aura of Protection

You radiate a protective, invisible aura that extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but it doesn't extend through Total Cover.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which one when entering the auras. 

### 8th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 9th Level: Abjure Foes

As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with divine awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Dazed and Frightened conditions for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. On a successful save, the target has the Dazed condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 

### 10th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Paladin subclass. 

### 11th Level: Radiant Strikes

You are so suffused with divine might that your weapon strikes carry supernatural power with them. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Simple or Martial weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage. 

### 12th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 13th Level: Aura of Courage

You and your allies are immune to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition is suppressed while the ally is there. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Paladin subclass. 

### 15th Level: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay on Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Dazed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay on Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature. 

### 16th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 17th Level: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection now extends 30 feet from you rather than 10 feet. 

### 18th Level: Divine Conduit

Whenever you roll Initiative, you regain one use of this class's Channel Divinity. 

### 19th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 20th Level: Epic Boon

You gain the following benefits:

***Ability Score Increase.*** Choose one of your ability scores. That score increases by 2, and this increase can raise the score above 20 but not above 30.  
***Epic Boon Feat.*** You gain the [Epic Boon of Truesight](/onednd/advancement/Feats#epic-boon-of-truesight) or another Epic Boon feat of your choice.
