If the creature is [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]], [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]], [[[general:conditions#paralyzed|paralyzed]]], or [[[general:conditions#stunned|stunned]]], the condition ends. If the creature is [[[general:conditions#prone|prone]]], it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs."""
