## Weapon Properties

Here are properties whose definitions have changed for this playtest. See the [current rules](/dnd/general/Equipment#weapon-properties) for the descriptions of all other weapon properties.

### Heavy

A Heavy weapon is unwieldy compared to other weapons. You have Disadvantage on your attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 and if it's a ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

### Light

When you take the [[glossary:Attack]] action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage, unless that modifier is negative.

For example, if you take the [[glossary:Attack]] action on your turn and have a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other -- each of which has the Light property -- you can make one attack with each weapon, using your action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action, unless that modifier is negative.

### Thrown

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack.

If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a Handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a Dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the Dagger has the Finesse property.

## Mastery Properties

Each weapon now has a Mastery property, as shown in the weapon tables above. That property is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character.

Here are descriptions of each Mastery property. The properties are provided in alphabetical order.

If a game feature lets you replace a weapon's Mastery property with another one, that weapon must meet any prerequisite specified for the new property.

### Cleave

_Prerequisite: Melee Weapon, Heavy Property_

If you hit a creature with a melee attack using this weapon, you can make an attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage, unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

[[accordion Cleave Weapons]]

| Name     | Damage        | Properties               | Type          | Weight | Cost  |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|:------:|:-----:|
| Greataxe | 1d12 Slashing | Heavy, Two-Handed        | Martial Melee | 7 lb.  | 30 GP |
| Halberd  | 1d10 Slashing | Heavy, Reach, Two-Handed | Martial Melee | 6 lb.  | 20 GP |

[[/accordion]]

### Graze

_Prerequisite: Melee Weapon, Heavy Property_

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can't be increased in any way, other than increasing the ability modifier.

[[accordion Graze Weapons]]

| Name       | Damage        | Properties               | Type          | Weight | Cost  |

| Greatsword | 2d6 Slashing  | Heavy, Two-Handed        | Martial Melee | 6 lb.  | 50 GP |

[[/accordion]]

### Nick

_Prerequisite: Light Property_

When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the [[glossary:Attack]] action, instead of as a Bonus Action. You can still make this extra attack only once per turn.

# Adventuring Gear

Here are descriptions of miscellaneous items whose rules have changed for this playtest.

## Net

_Cost: 1 GP. Weight: 3 lb._

When you take the [[glossary:Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a throw of the net at a creature within 15 feet of yourself. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Dexterity modifier. The target succeeds automatically if it's Huge or larger.

On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until it escapes the net. To escape, the target must use its action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, escaping on a success. A creature within 5 feet of the target can use its action to attempt the same thing. Destroying the net (AC 10; 5 HP; immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.

## Priest's Pack

_Cost: 33 GP. Weight: 29 lb._

A Priest's Pack contains the following items: Backpack (5 lb.), Blanket (3 lb.), Lamp (1 lb.), Holy Water (1 lb.), Rations (7 days; 14 lbs.), Robe (4 lb.), and Tinderbox (1 lb.).
