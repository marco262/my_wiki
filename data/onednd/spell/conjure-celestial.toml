You summon the protective presence of a Celestial spirit, which manifests as a pillar of divine light that shines in a 10-foot-radius, 40- foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Bright Light fills the Cylinder, and when you Move on your turn, you can also move the Cylinder up to 30 feet.

When a creature enters the Cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can bathe that creature in one of the following lights:

**Healing Light.** The creature that isn't an Undead or a Construct regains Hit Points equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting modifier. A creature can be healed by this light only once per casting of this spell.
**Searing Radiance.** The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
"""
