## What's Next?

At start of game, ask the players to describe themselves and their equipment, focusing on anything memorable.

Small retcon: [Xanner Silentbrush](^pirates/xanner_silentbrush.png) recommends everyone stay at the Mermaid's Kiss while he scouts out the aftermath of their job. Afterwards, Xanner will report that the guards are on high alert for murderers matching your description. Unfortunately, the party is VERY memorable. Xanner recommends that they lay low for a bit, and he'll let them know when the heat has cooled down. In the meantime, he can hook them up with small jobs (not "job" jobs like what they just did), if they want to pass the time.

He also warns them that they inadvertently chose the worst time to murder someone in the middle of the street, since a company of Knights of Twilight are stationed at Lord's Landing, and have joined in on the patrols with the city guard. He advises them to avoid guards and Knights, especially the latter. If you catch a single city guard by surprise and manage to take him out before anyone notices, that's one thing. But you *do not* want to mess with a Knight of Twilight, even alone.

Warn them that all gates and the docks will be watched closely, so trying to sneak out will be risky until the heat settles down.

After that, the players are allowed to do whatever they want for downtime. Roll dice, set up rivals, introduce complications... play it by ear. Look out for anything in any of the downtime activities that can lead directly into...

## Introduce Tuga

[Tuga](^pirates/marnie.jpg) will approach the party when they're in a tight bind, as part of a complication of one of their downtime activities, especially if it involves the Knights of Twilight. She'll use her Marnie persona to defuse the situation and let things go on their way.

## A New Job

At the end of the downtime period, Xanner will have a delivery for the players to Pleasure Island. It will be a crate full of fine wine, bon bons, and Binge. 

> Binge is a drug that makes a person immune to pain. For 1 minute after taking it, they ignore the effects of going to 0 HP. While high, they have an insatiable appetite. Binge-users often will eat the bodies of the people they kill mid-fight. However, every hit they take while at 0 HP still counts as a failed death saving throw. If they accrue three failed death saving throws, they die. If the high ends and they're still at 0 HP, they begin dying as normal.

Xanner will pay them 100 gp upon their return, assuming they make the delivery. But he'll warn them to keep the Knights of Twilight's paws off the crate, cause it is definitely contraband.

## Finding a Ship

> There are many, MANY ships down at [the docks](^pirates/lords_landing_docks.png). Merchant vessels, fishing vessels, cargo vessels. The most impressive vessels are the ones bearing the colors of the Knights of Twilight. These vessels vary in size, from the small and agile [sloops](^pirates/sloop.jpg), to the [frigates](^pirates/light_frigate.jpg), their hulls bristling with cannons and layered with sheets of iron. They stand out with their stark livery of black and yellow, visible in their folded sails and painted along the trim of the ships. But that is nothing compared to the enormous, [triple-masted beasts](^pirates/heavy_frigate_2.jpg) out in the harbor, too big to make it into the harbor. You can see smaller, single-sail dinghies sharing the Knights' colors both coming into the harbor and heading back out, ferrying sailors and supplies alike.

When they go looking for a ship, they'll find that all the reputable ships are only taking on new passengers after a check with the city guard. Except for [Yendan Snazzyfeet](^pirates/yendan_snazzyfeet.jpg) who's willing to take them aboard his [caravel](^pirates/caravel.jpg), the Bonnie Mistress. He'll charge an additional 5 gp fee for the trip per person due to "dangerous waters", though will be willing to waive that if they want to work on the ship, as crew and/or bodyguards.

## Prepare to be Boarded!

On their travels, a Knights of Twilight [1](^pirates/knight_of_twilight.png) ([stats](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#veteran_mm)) ship ([flag](^pirates/knights_of_twilight_crest.png)) will roll up on them and do a "routine check". The players will need to figure out how to hide on the ship using their own abilities.

If the session is running long, you can TBC here with the KoT ship calling out to them.

## Delays

The ship is becalmed for 1d4 hours. The crew takes time to chat with the party, play games, gamble, and pick the party's minds about what they're doing and where they're going in the interest of robbing them.

## Arriving at the Island

Once they get within range of Pleasure island ([1](^pirates/pleasure_island_day_1.jpg) [2](^pirates/pleasure_island_day_2.jpg), sunset [1](^pirates/pleasure_island_sunset_1.jpg) [2](^pirates/pleasure_island_sunset_2.jpg) [3](^pirates/pleasure_island_sunset_3.jpg), night [1](^pirates/pleasure_island_night_1.jpg) [2](^pirates/pleasure_island_night_2.jpg)), he'll turn on the players, and we TBC.
