description = """You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. The target can willingly fail the save.   While in the demiplane, the target is Incapacitated. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the save, ending the Spell on itself on a success. When the Spell ends on the target, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.   If the Spell lasts on the target for 1 minute and the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return. It is instead transported to a random location on a plane associated with its Creature Type."""
