*Most don't know it, but Ul'dah was once ours &mdash; the Lalafells'. Till the promise of gil brought in all the others, that is. Now I can't talk to half these leeches without looking up. Ruined my bloody neck, it has.*

&mdash; Neymumu, Ul'dahn Citizen

Long ago, the lalafell lived as masters of agriculture and spread across the land along trade routes, selling their produce and becoming one of the most widespread races there is. In time, the Dunesfolk became so wealthy, they established their own desert city-state known as Ul'dah. Though generally cheery, these tiny folk are highly ambitious and are not afraid to take hold of opportunity when it appears before them.

Their singularly business-minded nature can lead to them being perceived as greedy and calculating, but few can find in their hearts to entirely dislike the lalafell, with their inherently bright and jovial nature. As such, examples of lalafell being persecuted by other races are few and far between.

### Tiny Yet Mighty
Lalafell anatomy sees these kindly people rarely growing to be 3 feet tall. Their short bodies are rotund, with short feeble looking legs. But appearances can be deceiving, as lalafellin bodies are highly efficient, allowing them to travel long distances on their short legs. 

According to outside races, lalafell lack any sexual dimorphism short of males sometimes sporting facial hair. It can be often hard to tell at a glance what gender a lalafell is, nor even their age. 

Due to their general bodyshape (and their agricultural heritage), some crasser folk may — out of earshot, of course — disparagingly call them 'popotoes,' the word for potatoes in the Common tongue.

In regards to the lalafellin subraces themselves, the Plainsfolk have larger, pointed ears with greatly improved hearing, while the Dunesfolk developed a film which covers their eyes, protecting them from the sun and sand of the desert. 

### Products of the Land
When lalafell set out thousands of years ago from their homeland in the fertile isles of the South Seas, their landing places set the scene for two diverse peoples. The Plainsfolk started off as agriculturalists living their lives on their farms, eventually trading their goods across the land, as well as lalafellin children. The Dunesfolk began and remain as desert-dwelling folk, their bodies adapting to the harsh conditions. It is said that the Dunesfolk have long laced their teas with traces of venom, that they might better survive in a land rife with deadly snakes and scorpions.

### Rolling Planes and Towering Dunes
The lalafell can trace their ancestry back to two key areas. The Plainsfolk began as farmers across the southern seas, farming the fertile lands of their namesake. 

The Dunesfolk were not so lucky to have farmable land and instead turned to animal husbandry. Traditionally Dunesfolk built their homes on the backs of beasts of burden, traveling with their herds. Originally hailing from the fallen city of Mhach, the ancestors of the Dunesfolk sought a new homeland after its fall. Eventually, the Dunesfolk founded Ul'dah, a great city of wealth, where many of their kind live today.

### Family and Fortune
Lalafells care deeply for their small families and would do anything for them. They may set out on an adventure to support their families or in their defense. Not all lalafells have such pure goals though: ambition is rampant within the tiny lalafellin race. Their merchants traverse the most harrowing obstacles, their researchers seek knowledge in the most dangerous places, and their sellswords take on the hairiest tasks. Lalafells may be small, but they take on the world in a *big* way. 

### Lalafell Names
Lalafellin names are made up of a given name and a ‘courtesy name' bestowed upon reaching adulthood. The latter is not a family name, but rather unique to the individual. Lalafellin names trace their origins to songs and poems in the old tongue, and are ruled by rhyme, rhythm, and repetition.

This means that lalafells generally do not have surnames unless they come from royalty, which adds their family name in the middle. Each gender and subrace of lalafell have their own set of naming rules, detailed below. Each letter indicates a syllable or pair of syllables.
