## Plot

* One-Eyed Jacko works at a carnival stand, but hasn't been seen in a while. The players are directed to Jacko's home, where they find signs of a struggle. Asking around, they find out that Jacko was taken in the night by Gula's guards to The Tower.
  * If the players do really good investigating, they'll learn about an overheard conversation that talks about how Jacko's last batch of Binge was cut with cocaine, and he's going to be punished.
  * He's been taken to the tower to be The Entertainment.
* The PCs will have to figure out how to get into The Tower.
  * They can get in legitimately, or sneak in somehow.
  * There's a guard's entrance, a servant's entrance, trash chutes, infested moat, sewer.
* Every morning, five slots open up for people to enter The Tower.
  * Gula appears on a balcony over the front entrance to The Tower to address the masses and encourage people to compete to enter The Tower.
  * The Tower only wants people who know how to "take the goblet of Life in both hands, and drink until it's drained!" 
  * Gula will put forth a game for the people who want to get in. The five winners will be admitted.
  * Games:
    * Running of the bulls
    * Running away from starved bears
    * Catch the Stirge (have to get a pendant off a stirge)
    * Swim a lap through monster infested moat
    * Obstacle course over a minefield
* Every night, one or more prisoners are forced into The Grand Venue to be The Entertainment. They must do *something* to entertain the audience so they can live. If they're not entertaining enough, the audience will throw things on the stage floor, possibly hurting or killing the prisoner.
  * The audience might also chant for Gula to release one of various beasts into the Venue to chase down and kill the prisoner.
* The First Mate has recently been captured by another Lieutenant. Gula bought her and is keeping her in his Tower to turn her into the bread, so he can "eat his past".
  * She's hanging in a suspended cage above The Stage.


## Notes

* The motto of Pleasure Island is "More, More, More!"
