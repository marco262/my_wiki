[[breadcrumb /arr/class/Cleric|Cleric]]

Nature Clerics are usually based in the Twelveswood, and represent the Elementals. But though their magic comes from a more earthly source, it is no less White Magic than a Life Cleric's.

A Nature Cleric communes with the world around them, borrowing power from Elementals present throughout the world. They are by and large level-headed, respectful spell casters who are aware that overstepping one's bounds in the world of magic can lead to calamity, and seek to keep order within the magic world.

Nophica the Matron is the tender of soils and goddess of good harvests and abundance. She represents the nature that man cultivates. Oschon the Wanderer, on the other hand, is the god of wanderers and vagrants and ruler of the mountains. He represents the wilds untamed.

## Acolyte of Nature

At 1st level, you learn one cantrip of your choice from the [druid spell list](/dnd/class_spell_list/druid). You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival.

## Bonus Proficiency

Also at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

## Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to [[[general:conditions#charmed|charm]]] animals and plants.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]] by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]] by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.

## Dampen Elements

Starting at 6th level, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.

## Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
