## What Tomassin Knows

_(All of this is private knowledge that Tomassin will not divulge willingly, unless noted in another section)_

Gralhund Villa has been the headquarters for a large group of Zhentarim for a little over a year. They have combined efforts with the Zhentarim in their efforts to provide a black market of arms and mercenaries, rather than competing with them. Business has been very good, until recently. 

Urstul Floxin returned from a mission on the 23rd, burnt and badly injured. He and Yalah got in a shouting match upstairs, and Tomassin hasn't seen him since. A guard stationed at his room upstairs won't let anyone but Orund and Yalah in or out of the room, except whenever a servant has to bring Urstul his food.

Yalah and Orund have been particularly moody, arguing with each other more. 

The nimblewright is kept in attic storage above the ballroom. Tomassin has only seen it occasionally, and doesn't wish to interact with it, as she finds it creepy.

### Tea Party Conversation

The tea party will happen in Lord Gralhund's Den, as the Parlor is currently being occupied by Urstul Floxin.

Skill challenge. Three successes mean the PCs are able to chat with her as long as they like, and are invited to another tea party the next day. Three failures mean Tomassin ends the tea party early and doesn't invite them back. The PCs will need to make efforts to get back in her good graces.

**Possible rolls**

* Persuasion, to ingratiate themselves to her
* Deception, to pretend to be dumb enough to manipulate
* Performance, to tell entertaining stories
* Insight, to pick up on the next good conversation topic

**Things To Be Learned**

* Things are tense around the Villa lately.
* A number of servants and guards have quit (Day 2 or beyond).
* Yalah has been doing more "business" than usual in the last month.
* Zhentarim reguarly hang around Gralhund Manor, and have been in Tomassin's way, making her uncomfortable (Day 3, before the fight). 

### Chess Minigame

Skill challenge, best of three. Contested Intelligence (Chess) checks, each prefaced with another check to possibly gain advantage on the Intelligence (Chess) check:

* History, to identify opening moves
* Deception, to feint
* Insight, to discern the opponent's plans
* Sleight of Hand, to illegally move pieces without being noticed.

If the PC wins, they must make a Persuasion check to not earn Tomassin's ire. If they lose, it counts as a success for Tomassin's overall enjoyment of the tea party. (Note to self: Make it obvious to the players that intentionally losing will be the best way to get Tomassin in a good mood)

If Tomassin thinks she's guaranteed to win, she'll try to add wagers to the game. Some possible things she can wager:

* Periapt of Health
* Periapt of Proof Against Poison
* Periapt of Wound Closure
* Gem of Brightness
* Mithral Chainmail (In her room on Day 1, worn on Day 2+)
* Glamoured Studded Leather
* Elemental Gem (Yellow diamond -> Earth elemental)

## Expected Timeline

While the PCs meet with Tomassin, the Gralhund's conflict with the Zhentarim will progress day by day.

**Day 1**

* One guard is posted at the stairs leading to the second floor of Gralhund Villa. Visitors are not allowed upstairs without an escort.
* Two guards are posted in the parlor, keeping tabs on Urstul Floxin. He is under house arrest, but he is still recovering from his wounds so has not forced the matter.
* Both doors to the parlor are locked, and guards will 
* Some Zhentarim are hanging out upstairs in the servants' quarters.
* At some point, a servant will deliver three trays of food to the Parlor, needing to knock and be let in.

**Day 2**

* Urstul and Yalah got into a loud fight.
* Relations between the Zhentarim and the Gralhund staff is strained.
* A number of guards and staff have quit, sensing something bad will happen soon.
* Urstul has sent secret messages to the Zhentarim to be ready for a fight the next day.

**Day 3**

* The Zhentarim are more active around the house, dressed in cloaks and hiding their faces. The servants and guards unhappy about this as it puts them on edge.
* The fight will start in the parlor as Urstul attacks the guards. The other Zhents attack any other guards around them, leading to a slaughter.
* Urstul fights his way upstairs to try and get to the Gralhunds. 
* If possible, the Zhents will try to take any of the children hostage, including Tomassin.

## Possible Plot Hooks

* In Day 2 or beyond, Urstul will try to convince any PC who comes into contact with him to help him escape. He will claim he's being wrongfully imprisoned by the Gralhunds.
