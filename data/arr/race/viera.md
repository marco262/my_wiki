The Viera are a beautiful and mysterious folk, shrouded in mystery as many spend most of their lives in the Woodlands they call home. Their tall, slender bodies adorned with rabbit-like traits creates an air of grace amongst them. Long, high angled feet require high-heeled shoes and dextrous clawed fingers help to draw a striking image of the Viera.

## Separate Paths

The Viera are a race of both males and females, but outside of necessary meetings to keep their race continuing onwards and taking the male children who have reached adulthood, they lead separate lives. The males of the Viera live secretive, lonely lives in which they shun everyone, even their own kin to fully pursue their sacred role as a Wood-warder. The Wood-warders patrol the Golmore Jungle and ensure no outsiders reach their former homes. That isn't to say the women are defenseless though, as the female Viera are as capable as the men, but turn their attention to defend their young and homes.

## People of the Wood

The word Viera itself means "people of the wood" and true to their name, in different forests of Dalmasca. Both the Rava and the Veena boast tall, lithe frames and graceful traits of rabbits. The Rava make their home in the Golmore Jungle and grew to have umber skin and dark hair, allowing them to more easily blend in with the forest. In stark contract the Veena have very light skin and fair hair help them blend in with the Skatay Range they call home.

**Loyal To Others**

The Viera are a race of people who warm to others slowly, keeping other races at an arms length and keeping their own kind divided even further. But once someone manages to break through this hesitation they'll find a stalwart ally.

## Of Jungles and Forests

Both the Rava and Veena clans make their homes exclusively in the Golmore Jungle, or the primeval forests which line the southwestern foothills of the Skatay Range, respectively. Both locations are large, sprawling canopies of forest which provide them with all the Viera need to survive. In addition to the thick forest canopy, the Skatay Range boasts white mountains which the Veena has grown to use as a secondary home. Both the Rava and Veena guard their homes with violence and without prejudice, anyone who enters their forest homes may be privy to a hostile reception.

## The Green Word

The Viera's set of laws are considered to be the laws of the forest in which they live. The Viera take jobs under this set of laws and restrict themselves from having contact with the world outside of their forest. Among many other restrictions the Viera subject themselves to, some find their ways off putting. If a Viera chooses to leave the forest they are considered an outsider from that day forward. These strict laws often drive Viera with a fire in their heart away to seek adventure.

### Male-Specific Rava Surnames

Male Rava inhabit the forest surrounding the village in which female members of their clan reside, forming a sort of perimeter in defense of both the wood and its people. They believe that their purpose is to maintain the natural balance of the six elements in their dual polarities─to ensure harmony between the twelve aspects that comprise our star and the heavens above.

In accordance with this philosophy, each Rava surname begins with a syllable to represent either the celestial realm (Djt) or the worldly realm (Rehw), followed by a word that represents one elemental aspect within it. It is believed that those sharing a realm or an element possess a bond that grants them insight into one another’s minds, and as such are wont to join forces when the need for collaboration arises. Further rumors suggest that the Rava consider it necessary that all twelve different surnames be present among the Wood-warders’ ranks at any given time to ensure the forest’s safety and, should any be unaccounted for, will rename a member with a close affinity to said surname to fill the open spot.

### Male-Specific Veena Surnames

In the mountainous region inhabited by the Veena, villages are frequently enveloped by heavy snows. A male Veena’s surname marks him an integral, albeit small, part of this landscape, combining references to snow crystals with the word “wesfv”─“guardian.” However, as the snowflake-based themes employed and the number of surnames in use differ from village to village, the examples below should be considered only a small sampling of the possibilities.

Unlike the Rava, the Veena are not known to regard their Wood-warders as sharing any particular affinities or bonds due to their surnames.

## Viera Names

The Rava and Veena clans share many traditions, naming practices among them. Thus, a Viera’s forename is not indicative of the clan to which they belong─rather, it is the lifestyle they lead that determines whether they bear a “forest” or “city” forename.

Traditional Viera forenames given at birth are also referred to as “forest names,” as they are used by those Viera still residing in their homeland─which is the Golmore Jungle, in the case of the Rava, or the forest skirting the Skatay Range for the Veena. Forest names resemble real-world Scandinavian names and are pronounced similarly─in the names “Theja,” and “Nojra,” for instance, the “j” sounds more like an English “i.”

Because a Viera’s male or female characteristics are not present at birth, parents typically opt to bestow their children with names that are considered appropriate for any sex and gender. Nevertheless, in line with the cultural tradition of adopting a new name to suit one’s newfound environment or identity, many Viera choose to change their names upon reaching adulthood. Though in many cases male Viera will choose a traditionally “masculine” name, or female Viera a traditionally “feminine” one, there are myriad examples of Viera who eschew these patterns by keeping or choosing names that are culturally recognized as non-binary or associated with a different gender. For this reason, it is nearly impossible to determine whether a Viera is male or female by forename alone.

Furthermore, in keeping with the aforementioned tradition, the majority of Viera who choose to leave their homes and strike out into the wider world also adopt new “city names” to mark their parting from the traditional Viera way of life. These names are often inspired by the names of other races they encounter, or simply things that they like, such as “Cherry” or “Morning Glory,” and so vary widely between individuals. Incidentally, “Fran” is one such name.
