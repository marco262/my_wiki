*Who do you take us for!? We’re Ala Mhigans, and Ala Mhigans never forsake one another, hardships be damned! Remember the oath we swore, godsdammit─the oath to reclaim our homeland! We’ll set foot on Ala Mhigan soil again─together─or not at all! Do you understand me!?*

&mdash; Meffrid, Ala Mhigan revolutionary

Around a thousand years ago, the hyur spread across the land in a great migration from the North and made their homes wherever they could set their footing. Some took to the mountains, while others found a foothold in any city which would accept them. Today the hyur are one of the most populous races in the world.

### Of Average Build
The hyur are a race of average sized humanoids who lack any distinguishing features like pointed ears, immense size, or third eyes. Over time, hyur have diverged into two distinct groups: the Midlanders and the Highlanders. Midlanders are widespread across the land and come in all shapes and colors, becoming prevalent in all cities. Highlanders in comparison are taller than their Midlander counterparts, often boasting a more powerful, muscular build.

### A Matter of Location
The differences between the Midlanders and Highlanders were born from their differing ancestral homes. The mountains for which Highlanders are named are a difficult place to make a home. These extreme living conditions led to them being a heartier, more physically powerful people. The Midlanders, meanwhile, generally lived at sea level and could be found anywhere across the world.

### People of the World
Hyur as a whole make up a large percentage of the population in the world. Over a thousand years ago, the Midlander hyur immigrated in massive waves from their homelands and made their homes wherever their feet hit the ground. Highlanders, however, are famed for their mountainous city of Ala Mhigo. In recent years, however, due to the iron fist of the Garlean Empire, the Ala Mighans too have been forced from their homes to immigrate across the world. Highlanders can now be found mixing into the cities the world over.

### Glory and Prosperity
The hyur are a hardworking and ambitious people, no matter what walk of life they come from. It is for this reason that for every hyur in the world, there could be any number of motivations to seek adventure. Some may head out on the road for the value of the journey itself, while others may do so in search of riches. Some hyur may be adventuring on another's behalf — perhaps their family sitting at home, or to defend their people from an imminent threat. In a world with so many possibilities, it does not take much convincing to bring a hyur to action.

### Hyur Names
The names of the hyur are in the common tongue of the land. Midlanders may take names which are appropriate for the culture in which they live while Highlanders take names which have a harshness in their pronunciation. As a surname, Midlanders will often take a descriptive name for their physical traits or profession. Highlanders prefer to earn their surnames in battle, using feats of martial prowess or names with violent imagery.
