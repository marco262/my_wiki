***Consume Life.*** As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-wisp regains 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points.

***Ephemeral.*** The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The will-o'-wisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Variable Illumination.*** The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5 to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of ft. equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.
