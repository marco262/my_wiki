# The Vistani

If the PCs travel to Van Richten's tower after the dinner, he will not be present and will not arrive any time soon. If the PCs send a Paper Crane (very likely), he will respond with a Sending as soon as he gets it to Oren: *I am busy. Also, you are likely being watched. We will meet soon. I will Send for you when I am ready.*

Marblepaw will recommend they talk to the Vistani to ask for their favor... but maybe they can just learn about Strahd while they're there? The Vistani will welcome the party with open arms, and will happily take them in and treat them as honored guests. If they ask about Strahd's history, they'll be treated to a one-woman dance called the [Prastonata](https://old.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8a2b91/usefuloptional_fluff_collated_by_me/), accompanied by a song in the Vistani language where they will tell a story of Strahd's past as they know it. A nearby Vistani will whisper translations to them in Common as it goes on.

## Madame Eva

The Vistani don't have more info about the Amber Temple, or where it is or anything like that, just what they know from the song. But if the players insist on learning more, they are pointed to go see Madame Eva.

## What If My Party Is a Bunch Of Morons?

If the party still isn't piecing things together, have Marblepaw roll an Intelligence (History) check. She remembers when they were in Yaedrag, of the stories Elder Ormir told them of the Place of Power in the mountains, where darkness sleeps.

## Alternate Route

If the party doesn't follow the hook to the Amber Temple, or don't visit the Vistani, they will be visited by a golden eagle, which delivers the message from Elder Ormir of [Yaedrag](Tsolenka Pass#yaedrag) to inform them that they are in need of the party's help.

When the party gets to Yaedrag, they'll be told that Helwa, Chief Sigrid's daughter, is late returning from her rite of passage. She should have returned the previous day. They were about to head out to check on her themselves, but with the party passing by, they ask them to seek out Helwa. And if she's dead, at least to return with Shatterspike, her magic spear that has been in the family for generations, and is a symbol of the right to lead the tribe.

# Meanwhile...

Strahd should send a [love letter](^curse_of_strahd/strahds_love_letter.jpg) to Ireena. It will include a gift from Volenta for Oren: [A rose made of jet black beetle carapaces](^curse_of_strahd/black_rose.jpg).

# The Amber Temple

The party will learn everything [the temple](The Amber Temple) has to offer in the module/supplement, especially that Strahd was originally given his power by the Dark Power Vampyr. Make sure to have Ireena use her Divine Eminence power several times.

Make it so that the Amber Temple proves that Strahd did not lose his soul when he was turned into a vampire. This will make it so that there's justification for the idea that Strahd is not an irredeemable monster. Helps with player buy-in to the idea that Strahd can be redeemed with Ireena's love.

(Strahd IS an irredeemable monster, but that's just who he is. He's lost his ability to empathize with people during all his centuries as a moving corpse, and he was already very cruel and horrible to start with.)
