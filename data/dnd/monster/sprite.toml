If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the {@condition poisoned} target falls {@condition unconscious} for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

***Heart Sight.*** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a {@dc 10} Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

***Invisibility.*** The sprite magically turns {@condition invisible} until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is {@condition invisible} with it.
