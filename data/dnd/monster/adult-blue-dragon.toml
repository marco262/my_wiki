***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Lightning Breath {@recharge 5}.*** The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 ({@damage 12d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
