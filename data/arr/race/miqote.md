Many years ago I joined the Company of Heroes to hone my skills instead of challenging my predecessor before I was ready. Even when I was young I understood that victorrrry goes to the patient, the cunning, the pragmatic."_

The Miqo'te are an aloof people who value their independence from the world. Centuries ago the Miqo'te migrated, Seekers spreading across the world in low numbers while Keepers finding dense forests as a new home. Traditionally they avoid the other races, but over time more and more Miqo'te have integrated into society with pockets of die hard traditional Miqo'te tribes surviving out in the world.

## Lithe Hunters

The Miqo'te are a feline race with large catlike ears, fanged teeth and long tails. They have a highly tuned sense of smell and powerful legs, which have allowed them to become natural hunters. The Seekers of the Sun's ears are wider with thicker fur, while the Keepers of the Moon's ears are longer and stylized, with shorter fur. Futhermore, the eyes of the Seekers has developed such that the pupils are slit light, to help guard their eyes from the exposure of the sun, while the Keepers' pupils have become large and rounded. Many more women are born into the tribes and clans of the Miqo'te people.

**Reserved Watchers**

Miqo'te tend to keep to themselves, trying to avoid contact with races outside their own, Even in highly populated cities, individual Miqo'te lead isolated lives, preferring to stay aloof.

## Of Suns and Moons

The Seekers or the Sun and Keepers of the Moon are two distinct ethnicities falling under the Miqo'te. Their cultures differ greatly down to the social structures of their groups. The Seekers live in male dominant societies centered around an alpha male known as the Nuhn, and worship the god Azeyma. In contrast the Keepers live in a matriarchal society and worship the goddess Menphina.

## Arid Sands and Dense Woods

The hot, arid deserts of Southern Thanalan are home to one of the most famed tribes of the Seekers of the Sun. Seekers can be found anywhere across the world, barring cold regions with a harsh winter climate. Those who integrate into larger cities tend to discard their tribal ties and take up the social norms of the city in which they live. Keepers of the Moon have taken to the dense forests away from the heat of the sun.

## Adventure Calls

The Miqo'te tend to differ on their approach to life depending on their ethnicity. The Seekers of the Sun are bold individuals who are quick to jump into action, but also become bored easily. This natural need for excitement may call a Miqo'te to action, leading them out into the world to explore. Those from traditional tribes may leave their tribe seeking to start their own clan of Seekers, becoming the alpha of their group.

Keepers are guarded and brooding, which may stall them from setting out on a journey, but when the need arises to protect family, friends or their home, a Keeper will stop at nothing to protect that which they cherish.

Seekers of the sun use a simple naming convention. Male names are one or two syllables and preceded by a letter which is associated with the tribe. The extra aitches (H) we see in names such as represent a slight hissing/spitting sound that is made when the name is pronounced by the cat-like Miqoâ€™te. Many of the other races in Eorzea cannot accurately reproduce this sound, so the aitches (H) end up going silent when read. They do not take a family name, but instead are given the name Tia at birth. A Tia may change their surname to Nunh by challenging the tribes breeding male and defeating him in battle. If successful the two trade titles. Female seekers' first names are given in the same way with three or more syllables, but the surname is the first name of the breeding male who sired her.

The tribal prefix often gets dropped in casual conversation and with close friends and family.

The female Keepers use one to two syllable first names without a tribal prefix due to their small communities. Additionally in their culture the mother's surname is passed on to the children. The males born into the Keepers' communities take both of their mother's names, adding a suffix to the end of their first name to indicate their birth order counting the males. It is rare that more than 3 suffixes are needed.
