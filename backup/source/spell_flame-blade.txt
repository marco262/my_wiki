description: "You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.\n\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.\n\nThe flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet."
