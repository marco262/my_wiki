description = "<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.</p><p>The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.</p><p><strong>Power Strike.</strong> When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: <em>_[[[spell:cone of cold]]]_</em> (5 charges), <em>_[[[spell:fireball]]]_</em> (5th-level version, 5 charges), <em>_[[[spell:globe of invulnerability]]]_</em> (6 charges), <em>_[[[spell:hold monster]]]_</em> (5 charges), <em>_[[[spell:levitate]]]_</em> (2 charges), <em>_[[[spell:lightning bolt]]]_</em> (5th-level version, 5 charges), <em>_[[[spell:magic missile]]]_</em> (1 charge), <em>_[[[spell:ray of enfeeblement]]]_</em> (1 charge), or <em>_[[[spell:wall of force]]]_</em> (5 charges).</p><p><strong>Retributive Strike.</strong> You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.</p><p>You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Distance from Origin</th><th>Damage</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10 ft. away or closer</td><td>8 x the number of charges in the staff</td></tr><tr><td>11 to 20 ft. away</td><td>6 x the number of charges in the staff</td></tr><tr><td>21 to 30 ft. away</td><td>4 x the number of charges in the staff</td></tr></tbody></table>"
