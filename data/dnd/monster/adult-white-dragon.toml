***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 11} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) piercing damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) cold damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 14} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Cold Breath {@recharge 5}.*** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw, taking 54 ({@damage 12d8}) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
