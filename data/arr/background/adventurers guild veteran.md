### Ul'dah - The Quicksand

### Gridania - The Carline Canopy

Your local proprietress is "Mother" Miounne, a Wildwood woman aged thirty-six. Her tavern in New Gridania boasts an open terrace and mighty waterwheel, attracting many visitors. A talented herbalist and medicine woman, many come to her when they require a reliable hand.

### Revenant's Toll - The Seventh Heaven

Your local patron is Slafborn Rhotweitzsyn, a Sea Wolf man of forty-five summers. While not the proprietor of The Seventh Heaven, he'll put in a good word for you as the man elected to lead Revenant's Toll. He is honest, approachable, and a seasoned adventurer.
