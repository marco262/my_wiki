### Ethel

* Armor Class: 14
* Passive Per: 14
* Passive Ins: 12

Cursed with Lycanthropy

* Around the night of the full moon, Charisma save every 2 hours to resist the Beast inside them.
  * 2 days before (DC 5), 1 day before (DC 10), Night of the full moon (DC 15), 1 day after (DC 10), 2 days after (DC 15)
  * If they fail, they transform into their hybrid form and go on a rampage.
  * While transformed, they can continue to make the save every 2 hours, transforming back on a success.
  * If they choose not to resist the curse, they transform completely and cannot make saves for the rest of the night.
  * Indulging in killing/wanton destruction throughout the night can keep the Beast at bay.

* Weapon from Kavan

### Notes for me

* Ezmerelda meets the party on the road, asks for help going to the tower to get her cart

#### Yester Hill

* Plan out what the players are told by Kavan about the Fanes, Strahd, the spear, the holy artifacts, etc.

#### Vallaki

* Mention how the people of Vallaki are all putting on fake smiles when out in public "as usual".
* Mention Bluto, the Blue Water Inn's "best customer". He usually trades fish for wine, but hasn't been seen in a while.
* Ireena wants to attended service at the church to pay her respects to the Morning Lord.
  * Give the [Arabelle](Town of Vallaki#missing-vistana) hook here
  * Willemina Rikalova will be talking about her husband(??)
* Have Ernst spying on the players
* Have Rictavio's tiger break out?
