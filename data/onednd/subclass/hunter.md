You stalk prey in the wilds and elsewhere, using your abilities as a Hunter to protect nature and people everywhere from forces that would destroy them. 

### 3rd Level: Hunter's Prey

Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a creature with a Weapon or an Unarmed Strike as part of the Attack Action on your turn, the Weapon or Unarmed Strike deals an extra 1d8 damage to the target if it's missing any of its Hit Points. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. 

### 6th Level: Hunter's Lore

You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your *Hunter's Mark*, you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, and Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are. 

### 10th Level: Multiattack

You now always have *Conjure Barrage* prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of Spells you can prepare.

You can also cast the Spell with 1st- and 2nd-level Spell Slots. When you do so, the Spell's damage is reduced by 1d8 for each slot level below 3rd. 

### 14th Level: Superior Hunter's Defense

When you are hit by an Attack Roll, you can use your Reaction to halve the attack's damage against yourself, and you can redirect the other half of the damage to one creature (other than the attacker) that you can see within 5 feet of yourself.
