[[breadcrumb /arr/class/Cleric|Cleric]]

Void Clerics, sometimes called Reapers, draw their power from a contract with their special voidsent ally, the Void Avatar. Using the gift of a personal macabre memento to channel dark magics, Reapers mix martial prowess with magic pulled from the void itself to bring destruction to evil doers.

The gods of the Void are Nald'Thal the Traders, who is the overseer of the underworld and god of commerce, and Rhalgr the Destroyer, who is the god of destruction.

## Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

## Reaper

At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

## Channel Divinity: Touch of the Void

Starting at 2nd level, you can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice your cleric level.

## Inescapable Destruction

Starting at 6th level, your ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

## Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an a 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Improved Reaper

Starting at 17th level, when you cast a necromancy spell of 1st through 5th level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for each target.
