***False Appearance.*** While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal boulder.

***Rolling Charge.*** If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 ({@damage 2d6}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 16} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.

***Slam.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) bludgeoning damage.

***Animate Boulders (1/Day).*** The galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders it can see within 60 feet of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}, and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell).
