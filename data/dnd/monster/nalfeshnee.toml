***Multiattack.*** The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}32 ({@damage 5d10 + 5}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 3d6 + 5}) slashing damage.

***Horror Nimbus {@recharge 5}.*** The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.

***Teleport.*** The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
