*From the angry seas of the Northern Empty to howling mountain peaks, the Roegadyn have historically made their home in rugged, inhospitable climes. Theirs is a culture<br>that exalts the strong and looks down upon the weak, both among their own kind and outsiders. This is by no means limited to feats of physical strength &mdash; even a wee Lalafell might win a Roegadynâ€™s respect with a display of mystical power or strength of will. Those who show no such qualities, however, will find it difficult to convince a Roegadyn to so much as give them the time of day without an exchange of coin.*

&mdash; Encyclopedia Eorzea

The roegadyn are a physically powerful race of people with a thirst for life which few can rival. They live loudly with boisterous voices, larger-than-life goals, and an unflinching approach to danger. Roegadyn are fearless explorers who long ago were the greatest pirates to sail the seas.

### Size Matters
Roegadyn are enormous humanoids with a hulking muscular build. Men and women alike grow to tower over the other races. Partly due to their size, roegadyn as a whole love competitions of strength and courage, challenging one another to push themselves and their bravery. Their faces have fierce features and large flat noses.

### Maritime Rovers, Volcanic Hermits
The Sea Wolves live up to their names through a storied history on the ocean. Most Sea Wolf communities can be found on the coast, as most make their living from the sea. Be it sailing, naval service, or mercenary work, the Sea Wolves continue to feel most at home when adventuring on board a ship. 

The Hellsguard, in comparison, live inland around the volcanic mountains of Abalathia. Here they guard the material plane from undead spirits trying to return home. It is clan tradition to enter the mercenary trade; thus the Hellsguard took to giving themselves easily remembered names made up of words in the common tongue.

### The Great Seas and Abalathia
The roegadyn as an entire race hail from the Northern seas, their name translating to "people of the rain." These sea-faring people can be found living in coastal cities the world over as sailors, mercenaries and pirates. 

The Hellsguard live around the volcanoes of the Abalathia mountains, believing their home to be a sacred place related to the afterlife. Those Hellsguard who choose to leave their mountain homes can be found in large cities near these mountains, making a living as sellswords or chasing deeper knowledge of magic.

### In Their Nature
The roegadyn people are a boisterous race, seeking out challenges to test their power and bravery. They rarely need much convincing to head into the heat of battle for a cause they believe in, though coin may help speed them along. Sea Wolves have a long history of pirating, looting and battle on ships of all sorts, giving them a deep-seated thirst for adventure. 

Hellsguard grow up in solitude away from society, having no city to call their own. They may decide to head off in search of a more engaging existence by heading down their mountain and seeing what else the world has to offer.

### Roegadyn Names
Despite appearances, Sea Wolves and Hellsguard follow only slightly different rules when it comes to naming conventions. All roegadyn derive their names by combining words. However, where Sea Wolves use words from their ancient roegadyn tongue, Hellsguard prefer the common tongue. 

Women of the Hellsguard tend to use plant imagery in their names as well, but this is by no means universal. Nearly all Hellsguard abandon their family names, refusing to be defined by their ancestors in the past.
