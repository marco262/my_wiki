This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the _[[[spell:detect evil and good]]]_ spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

||~ d20 ||~ Alignment ||
|| 1-2 || Chaotic evil ||
|| 3-4 || Chaotic neutral ||
|| 5-7 || Chaotic good ||
|| 8-9 || Neutral evil ||
|| 10-11 || Neutral ||
|| 12-13 || Neutral good ||
|| 14-15 || Lawful evil ||
|| 16-17 || Lawful neutral ||
|| 18-20 || Lawful good ||

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the _[[[spell:gate]]]_ spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
