[Count Strahd von Zarovich](^curse_of_strahd/strahd_6.jpg) is wearing a [Crown of Disguise](^curse_of_strahd/crown_of_disguise.jpg).

Strahd Q&A:

* **Will he submit to Zone of Truth?** Yes, without concern or complaint.
* **Why Ireena?** Do you believe in souls? More importantly, do you believe in soulmates? When I look at Ireena, I know who she truly is: My beloved Tatyana. My one. My only. We are destined for each other. Did you not feel it, Ireena? When you looked upon Kelemen's face? A connection? My apologies for the facade, but when the world sees you as a monster, do you have any choice but to play the part?
  * *to Marblepaw* Destiny destiny destiny
  * *to Orin* Romance romance romance
  * *to Ethel* Angst, self-doubt, trauma, suffering, growth, healing
* **Why Barovia?** It is my home. I am its ruler, and the people my subjects. I could no more abandon it than a head could abandon its body.
* **Why the croissants?** ... I don't understand the question.

Partway through the discussion (or if the party seems to be digging too hard into Strahd), have Father Lucian knock on the door and ask if everything's okay. Strahd will take the opportunity of the brief distraction to turn back into Kelemen. After Father Lucian is turned away, Strahd/Kelemen will suggest that their current meeting place is too public. Instead, he invites them to dinner at Castle Ravenloft. He gives his word that they will leave the dinner with their lives and their sanity.

Strahd has a decorative [holy symbol of the Morninglord](^curse_of_strahd/lathander-03.jpg) which he intended to give to Ireena as a gift. If allowed, he will present it to her as parting gift.
