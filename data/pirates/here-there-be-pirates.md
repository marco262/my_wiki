# Campaign Synopsis

> Set beyond the Skyshear Mountains, the Sunset Isles are a wonderland of beautiful islands, rich in resources and adventure. The people living there carved out little nooks of civilization, spreading to the different islands and setting down roots. Over time, each settlement developed its own culture and identity, distinct from the others but ultimately harmonious. The mainland towns and the islands shared their trade, letting the people in this area prosper. 
> 
> But there is always someone out there who wants what you have. 20 years ago, the Dread Pirate Lord's fleets sailed in from the west, and aimed to make the Sunset Isles their own. His forces were ruthless and strong, taking life and plunder with delight and dread efficiency. The previously peaceful people of the Isles eventually took up arms and managed to kill the Dread Pirate Lord and stop his invasion, but at great cost. Their previously prosperous nation was broken, with many historical sites burned to the ground. Countless lives were lost, and the Sunset Isles are still suffering the predations of his lieutenants. Still, hope has rekindled as many people they can eventually return to the peaceful life they once had. 

## Historical Timeline

* **1521:** The Dread Pirate Lord's fleet sails into the Sunset Isles and invades their first island.
* **1522:** The Dread Pirate Lord controls or has decimated half the islands in the Sunset Isles. He has started making assaults on the mainland. 
* **1523:** The Knights of Twilight are established, to gather together all able-bodied warriors in the Sunset Isles.
* **1524:** The first victory against the Dread Pirate Lord is achieved, driving him out of one island.
* **1525:** The Dread Pirate Lord's forces are pushed back, routed from many of their holdings throughout the isle.
* **1526:** The Knights of Twilight meet the Dread Pirate Lord in battle in his own fortress. He is killed, his head removed from his body, and his belongings tossed into the sea. His remaining forces split, each of his lieutenants taking their own ships and setting out on their own.
* **1546:** Present day

## Notes

* The islands range from inhabited to wild to overrun with pirates. In general, the farther west you go, the more dangerous it is.
* Four different pirate fleets roam the Sunset Isles, fighting amongst each other as much as they plunder the remaining settlements of the Sunset Isles.
* The Knights of Twilight patrol the mainland, and some of the nearest islands, keeping the peace and swiftly punishing any criminal acts.
* The people of the Sunset Isles are generally very hostile to any talk of the Dread Pirate Lord that doesn't paint him as an irredeemable monster. But in recent years, some grumblings have arisen speaking out against the common thought.
