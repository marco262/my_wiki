***Advanced Telepathy.*** The flumph can perceive the content of any telepathic communication used within 60 feet of it, and it can't be surprised by creatures with any form of telepathy.

***Prone Deficiency.*** If the flumph is knocked [[[general:conditions#prone|prone]]], roll a die. On an odd result, the flumph lands upside-down and is [[[general:conditions#incapacitated|incapacitated]]]. At the end of each of its turns, the flumph can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, righting itself and ending the [[[general:conditions#incapacitated|incapacitated]]] condition if it succeeds.

***Telepathic Shroud.*** The flumph is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells.

***Tendrils.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (1d4) acid damage on a failure or ending the recurring acid damage on a success. A *[[[spell:lesser restoration]]]* spell cast on the target also ends the recurring acid damage.

***Stench Spray (1/Day).*** Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the flumph must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for 1d4 hours. The coated creature is [[[general:conditions#poisoned|poisoned]]] as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are [[[general:conditions#poisoned|poisoned]]] while within 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
