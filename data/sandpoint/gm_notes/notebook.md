* Add to wiki page: 
* Add to references: 
* Note to self: Add fire theming to this campaign
* Drop info about the origin of Malfeshnekor as they explore Thistletop
* Connect Stoot with the Skinsaw Cult somehow
* When a player is exploring a space, put them on a map, even if you just have to sketch something really quick.
* Prepare background music for Thistletop level D
* Badly photoshop the dented crown onto Delfi's head
* Figure out how many keys are on Ripnugget's keyring (more keys = more important)
* Make a loot list for the masterwork dogslicer
* Figure out what languages Rusty can choose from at chargen

Next session:

* Goblin dogs will bark and try to beat down the door
* Decide if the guards outside have heard the commotion (probably yes)
* The warchanter (with a jester's hat) is hiding in the chieftain's bedroom (C23)

Pre-session checklist:

* Re-explain basic concepts
  * Action, bonus action, movement, reactions
  * Attack rolls and critical hits
  * Skill checks
* Adventurer's Intuition (insight checks for hints)
* Remind players about potion homebrew rules
* Have everyone go over their abilities!
* Ask for party leader!
* Recap
* Use 3 minute combat timer!

Q&A:

* Why did Tsuto want to talk to Ameiko?
  * To talk her into joining Nualia's band
* Was Father Tobyn Nualia's real father?
  * Nah. Interesting, but it adds unnecessary complications

Player Plans:

Silly notes:

* Choppy McJervis
* Introduce a character named Red Herring
* Fancifer the Vicarious
* Utharu the Dickish (goblin chief?)
* Cappy Pasta, an infamous source of dubious knowledge
