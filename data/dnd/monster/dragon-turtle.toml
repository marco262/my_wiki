***Multiattack.*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}26 ({@damage 3d12 + 7}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}16 ({@damage 2d8 + 7}) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 13} to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. {@h}26 ({@damage 3d12 + 7}) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 20} Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked {@condition prone}.

***Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.*** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw, taking 52 ({@damage 15d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
