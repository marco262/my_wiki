## Archaelogist
An archaeologist learns about the rich tapestry of Eorzea's past by studying the remains of her many fallen civilizations â€“ their bones, their ruins, their surviving masterworks, and their tombs. Those who practice archaeology travel to the far corners of Hydaelyn to root through ancient technological ruins from Allag or more arcane civilizations like the ancient cities of Mhach and Amdapor, digging in search of artifacts that might tell the truer, deeper stories of the calamities.

### Signature Item
Prior to becoming an adventurer, you spent most of your young life crawling around in the dust, pilfering relics of questionable value from crypts and ruins. Though you managed to sell a few of your discoveries and earn enough coin to buy proper adventuring gear, you have held onto an item that has great emotional value to you. Roll on the Signature Item table to see what you have, or choose an item from the table.

|  1  | 10-foot pole, carved with mysterious symbols |
|  2  | Medallion, etched with an ancient civilization's seal |
|  3  | Crowbar. It's just useful! |

|  6  | Tinkerer's sledgehammer, fueled by ancient technology |
|  7  | Hooded lantern wrought in curious designs |

### Feature: Historical Knowledge
When you enter a ruin or dungeon, you can correctly ascertain its original purpose and determine its builders, whether those were elezen, lalafellin, hrothgari, or even ancient Allagan. In addition, you can determine the monetary value of art objects more than a century old.

### Suggested Characteristics
Few archaeologists can resist the lure of an unexplored ruin or dungeon, particularly if such a site is the source of legends or is rumored to contain the treasures and relics of mages, warlords, or royalty. Some archaeologists plunder for wealth or fame, while others consider it their calling to illuminate the past or keep the world's greatest treasures from falling into the wrong hands. Whatever their motivations, archaeologists combine the qualities of a scrappy historian with the self-made heroism of a treasure-hunting scoundrel.
