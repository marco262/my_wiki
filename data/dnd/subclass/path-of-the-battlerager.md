> Closest to the dark elves, Pwent lowered his head, with its long helmet spike, and impaled one elf through the chest, blasting through the fine mesh of drow armor easily and brutally. The second drow managed to deflect the next battlerager's charge, turning the helmet spike aside with both his swords. But a mailed fist, the knuckles devilishly spiked with barbed points, caught the drow under the chin and tore a gaping hole in his throat. Fighting for breath, the drow managed to score two nasty hits on his opponent's back, but those two strikes did little in the face of the flurry launched by the wild-eyed dwarf.

Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.

# Path of the Battlerager

||~ Barbarian Level ||~ Feature ||
|| 3rd || Battlerager Armor ||
|| 6th || Reckless Abandon ||
|| 10th || Battlerager Charge ||
|| 14th || Spiked Retribution ||

## Restriction: Dwarves Only

Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.

## Battlerager Armor

[[div class="errata"]]

**Editor's Note:** It's recommended that you give the Battlerager proficiency in Smith's Tools, and the ability to add spikes to any medium armor for a cost of 25 gp.

[[/div]]

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain the ability to use [[[general:Equipment#armor-and-shields|spiked armor]]] as a weapon.

While you are wearing spiked armor and are raging, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack with your armor spikes against a target within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the spikes deal 1d4 piercing damage. You use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Additionally, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature, the target takes 3 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds.

## Reckless Abandon

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.

## Battlerager Charge

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action while you are raging.

## Spiked Retribution

Starting at 14th level, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 3 piercing damage if you are raging, aren't [[[general:conditions#incapacitated|incapacitated]]], and are wearing spiked armor.
