> Revised Ranger can be found [[[class:revised-ranger|here]]].

Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the ores he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.

After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.

Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.

Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

## Deadly Hunters

Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization -- humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.

Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.

## Independent Adventurers

Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger's true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first -- and possibly the last -- line of defense.

This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion.

But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.

# Creating a Ranger

As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain -- perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

What's the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change?

What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?

## Quick Build

You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the [[[background:outlander]]] background.

## Deft Explorer

_1st-level ranger feature (replaces Natural Explorer)_

You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor. Choose one of the following benefits, and then choose another one at 6th and 10th level.

### Canny

Choose one skill: Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. You gain proficiency in the chosen skill if you don't already have it, and you can add double your proficiency bonus to ability checks using that skill.

In addition, thanks to your extensive wandering, you are able to speak, read, and write two languages of your choice.

### Roving

Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

### Tireless

As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this special action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.

## Favored Foe

_1st-level ranger feature (replaces Favored Enemy)_

You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the _[[[spell:hunter's mark]]]_ spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a certain number of times without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration -- a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you gain the Spellcasting feature at 2nd level, _[[[spell:hunter's mark]]]_ doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

[[/accordion]]

## Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

### Blind Fighting

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

Being unable to see a creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn't hidden from you.

### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

### Druidic Warrior

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

### Interception

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

### Thrown Weapon Fighting

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.

### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Unarmed Fighting

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.

When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.

## Martial Versatility

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace a fighting style you know with another style available to this class. This change represents a shift of focus in your martial training and practice, causing you to lose the benefits of one style and gain the benefits of another style.

## Spellcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See the [[[general:Spellcasting Rules]]] section and the [ranger spell list](/dnd/class_spell_list/ranger/true).

### Spell Slots

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher.[((bibcite errata))] To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [ranger spell list](/dnd/class_spell_list/ranger/true).

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Spell Versatility

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the ranger spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

### Spellcasting Focus

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

You can use a [[[equipment:adventuring-gear|druidic focus]]] as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells.

## Ranger Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an [[[class:ranger#ranger-archetypes|archetype]]] that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

## Primeval Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

[[accordion Variant Class Features]]

## Primal Awareness

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

_3rd-level ranger feature (replaces Primeval Awareness)_

You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the following table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

||~ Level ||~ Spell ||
|| 3rd || _[[[spell:detect magic]]]_, _[[[spell:speak with animals]]]_ ||
|| 5th || _[[[spell:beast sense]]]_, _[[[spell:locate animals or plants]]]_ ||
|| 9th || _[[[spell:speak with plants]]]_ ||
|| 13th || _[[[spell:locate creature]]]_ ||
|| 17th || _[[[spell:commune with nature]]]_ ||

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

[[/accordion]]

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Land's Stride

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to im pede movement, such those created by the *[[[spell:entangle]]]* spell.

## Hide in Plain Sight

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

[[accordion Variant Class Features]]

## Fade Away

_Source:_ <https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/downloads/UA-ClassFeatures.pdf>

_10th-level ranger feature (replaces Hide in Plain Sight)_

You can use a bonus action to magically become invisible, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

[[/accordion]]

## Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

## Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

## Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
