**Children of Two Humanoid Races**

Humanoids of different races sometimes have children together. For example, people who have a human parent and an orc or an elf parent are particularly common. Many other combinations are possible.

If you'd like to play the child of such a pairing, choose two Race options that are Humanoid to represent your parents. Then determine which of those Race options provides your game traits: Size, Speed, and special traits. You can then mix and match visual characteristics -- color, ear shape, and the like -- of the two options. For example, if your character has a halfling and a gnome parent, you might choose Halfling for your game traits and then decide that your character has the pointed ears that are characteristic of a gnome.

Finally, determine the average of the two options' Life Span traits to figure out how long your character might live. For example, a child of a halfling and a gnome has an average life span of 288 years.

Towering over most folk, Goliaths are distant descendants of giants. Each Goliath bears the blessings of the first giants -- blessings that manifest in various supernatural boons, including the ability to quickly grow and temporarily approach the height of the Goliaths' gigantic kin.

Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For example, some Goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants. Whatever giants they count as kin, Goliaths have forged their own path in the multiverse -- unencumbered by the internecine conflicts that have ravaged giant-kind for ages -- and seek heights above those reached by their ancestors.
