Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can't be contained within speech or even song; they are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of even the smallest creatures. To these Bards, dance is art freed from the constraints of a single point in space and time; it is meaning unconfined by narrow definitions of words and structures of grammar. The College of Dance practices a way of being in harmony with the ever-whirling cosmos, emphasizing agility, speed, and grace.

### 3rd Level: Dazzling Footwork

Your practice of dance gives you the ability to gracefully dodge and make agile strikes. While you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits:

**Unarmored Defense.** Your base Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.  
**Agile Strikes.** When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one [[glossary:Unarmed Strike]] as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.  
**Bardic Damage.** You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your [[glossary:Unarmed Strike|Unarmed Strikes]], and when you deal damage with an [[glossary:Unarmed Strike]], you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier. This roll doesn't expend the die.

### 3rd Level: Inspiring Movement

When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of an ally of yours who is within 60 feet of you, you can use your Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half your Speed. Then roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and the ally can move up to a number of feet equal to 5 times the number rolled. None of this feature's movement provokes Opportunity Attacks.

### 6th Level: Leading Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and you take only half damage if you fail. If any creatures within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this benefit with them for that save.

You can't use this feature if you have the [[glossary:Incapacitated]] condition.

### 6th Level: Tandem Footwork

When you roll Initiative, you can spend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don't have the [[glossary:Incapacitated]] condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and choose a number of creatures within 60 feet of yourself (you can choose yourself), up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of them gains a bonus to their Initiative equal to the number rolled.

### 14th Level: Irresistible Dance

You always have the _[[[spell:Otto's Irresistible Dance]]]_ spell prepared. You can cast it without expending a spell slot. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of the feature by expending four uses of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).
