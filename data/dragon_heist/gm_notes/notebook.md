## Available Plot Hooks

* Go talk to Halgraek Barrelshoulder to get troll skull
  * He wants either 500 gp or help with sabotaging his neighbor who has a nicer house than him
* Doom Raiders Mission, "On Dasher"
* Harpers Mission, "Welcome to the Family"
* Tommassin asks after Emir, clearly smitten
* Grinda Garloth has offered 100gp if they find where her family's bodies were taken.
* Blossom Snobeedle has offered 750gp to "scare Dasher straight"

---

* Uncle David will threaten Emir when he's coming back with the treasure if he doesn't take the treasure back to his family

## TODO
