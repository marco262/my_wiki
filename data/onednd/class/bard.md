**Primary Ability:** Charisma

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions.

Bards believe that the creators of the multiverse spoke and signed it into existence and that remnants of those Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. The magic of Bards is an attempt to harness those words -- which transcend any language -- and direct them to create new wonders.

Because the Words of Creation resonate throughout the cosmos, different Bards choose different approaches to their magic. Some Bards practice their arts in temples or monasteries, drawing on the power of the Outer Planes to channel divine magic. Others listen to bird song and the music of the wind, associate with Druid circles, and wield primal magic. Still others immerse themselves in the study of magical lore, collecting scraps of mystic knowledge wherever their journeys take them as they master the secrets of arcane magic. Ultimately, though, these various paths converge as the most accomplished Bards learn to access almost the entire breadth of magical potential.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and develop an aptitude to do almost anything well. Bards become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

Not every singer or poet in a tavern or jester in a royal court is a Bard. Harnessing the Words of Creation requires hard work and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. A Bard's life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards' depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

## Creating a Bard

<div class="phb-sidebar" markdown="1">

**Multiclassing and the Bard**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Bard as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Bard's primary ability, Charisma, to take a level in this class or to take a level in another class if you're already a Bard.

***Proficiencies.*** If Bard isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first Bard level: one skill of your choice and one Musical Instrument of your choice.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Bard level, you gain [[glossary:armor training]] with Light Armor.

***Spell Slots.*** Add all your Bard levels to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots for casting spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare spells for each of your classes individually, referring to the spell slots of an individual class to determine the number and levels of the spells you prepare for it.

</div>

To create a Bard, consult the following lists, which provide Hit Points, proficiencies, and [[glossary:armor training]]. If you're making a 1st-level character, also consult the [Starting Equipment](#starting-equipment) section, and if you're using the multiclassing rules, see the "Multiclassing and the Bard" sidebar.

Then look at the Bard table to see the Class Features you get at each level in this Class. The descriptions of those features appear in the [Bard Class Features](#bard-class-features) section.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Bard level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points per Level after 1st:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier  

#### Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Charisma  
**Skills:** Any three Skills of your choice  
**Weapons:** Simple Weapons  
**Tools:** Three Musical Instruments of your choice  

#### Armor Training

Light Armor

### Starting Equipment

As a 1st-level character, you start with the following equipment, or you can forgo it and spend 100 GP on equipment of your choice.

* Dagger (2)
* Entertainer's Pack
* Leather Armor
* Musical Instrument (one of your choice)
* 26 GP

## Bard Class Features

As a Bard, you gain the following Class Features when you reach the specified levels in this Class. These features are listed on the Bard table.

### 1st Level: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

***Using Bardic Inspiration.*** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. 

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [[glossary:d20 Test]], the creature can roll that die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.

***Number of Uses.*** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

***At Higher Levels.*** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard table. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Bard.


***Cantrips.*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Bard spell list](/onednd/spell_list/bard). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Minor Illusion]]]_ and _[[[spell:Vicious Mockery]]]_.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Bard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach levels 4 and 10 in this class, you learn another Bard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of spells of level 1 and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the [Bard spell list](/onednd/spell_list/bard). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Cure Wounds]]]_, _[[[spell:Dissonant Whispers]]]_, _[[[spell:Heroism]]]_, and _[[[spell:Thunderwave]]]_.

The number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six Bard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**Houserule: Changing Your Prepared Spells**

Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace any spells on your list with the same number of Bard spells for which you have spell slots.

</div>

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with your Bard features.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a musical instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you cast with your Bard features.

### 2nd Level: Expertise

You gain [[glossary:Expertise]] in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

Performance and Persuasion are iconic choices for a Bard if you have proficiency in them. 

### 2nd Level: Jack of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn't otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check. 

### 3rd Level: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice, listed at the end of this class description.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Bard level and lower. 

### 4th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 5th Level: Font of Inspiration

You now also regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a [[glossary:Short Rest]].

In addition, if you have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required). You can do so only once per turn. 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Bard subclass. 

### 7th Level: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can use your Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage. 

### 8th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 9th Level: Expertise

You gain [[glossary:Expertise]] in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. 

### 10th Level: Magical Secrets

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**Editor's Note**

Because the Arcave/Divine/Primal spell lists are apparently in the process of being phased out, this feature has been changed so Magical Secrets now gives you access to all non-exclusive spells.

</div>

You have collected magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. As a result, your Bard spell list now also includes all spells not limited to a single class.

### 12th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Bard subclass. 

### 16th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 18th Level: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain two expended uses of it. 

### 19th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 20th Level: Words of Creation

You have mastered two of the prime Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the _[[[spell:Power Word Heal]]]_ and _[[[spell:Power Word Kill]]]_ spells prepared, and when you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with the spell, provided that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

# Bard Subclasses

A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass.

Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their gatherings and preserve their traditions.

* [[[subclass:College of Dance]]]
* [[[subclass:College of Glamour]]]
* [[[subclass:College of Lore]]]
* [[[subclass:College of Valor]]]
