***Multiattack.*** The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d8 + 3}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw against disease or become {@condition poisoned} until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 ({@dice 1d10}) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Tentacle.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}7 ({@damage 1d8 + 3}) bludgeoning damage plus 4 ({@damage 1d8}) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 13}) and {@condition restrained} until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Tentacle Slam.*** The otyugh slams creatures {@condition grappled} by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or take 10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) bludgeoning damage and be {@condition stunned} until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't {@condition stunned}.
