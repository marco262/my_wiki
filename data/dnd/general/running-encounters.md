# Social Interaction

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 244_

Each social interaction goes through four phases:

1. ***Starting Attitude.*** Determine the starting attitude of the NPC: **friendly**, **indifferent**, or **hostile**.
2. ***Conversation.*** This covers **all RP** the players have with the NPC, and may adjust the attitude of the NPC by at most **one step** in most circumstances. A player may make an **Insight check** as part of their interaction with an NPC to determine the NPC's traits, bonds, flaws, and other things that might help the player figure out how to influence the NPC.
3. ***Charisma Check.*** At the end of the conversation, the players must make a Charisma check (Persuasion, Intimidation, etc.). The NPC's reaction to the conversation is based on the **Conversation Reaction** tables below.
4. ***Repeat?*** Once a Charisma check has been made, further attempts to influence the target of the interaction might be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward hostility.
