## Notes for Next Session

* Marbleclaw and Orin are at the top of a tree.
* When they leave the forest, have them come out onto the road. And when they turn around, they can see the fog thick as a wall behind them.
* Have them come across a Vistani caravan? Look into when this should happen.
* Have them meet Lord Jared? Maybe after they visit the Village of Barovia
