# Basic Rules

## Order of Precedence

There is an order of precedence that determines how important a card is in a reading.

The High Deck is the most dominant...if using a layout where multiple cards are placed to determine one thing (see below) and a High Deck card is included...all other cards will be interpreted in whatever context the High Deck card applies. I'll explain this more below. Beyond this, cards placed first are generally given higher priority, determining the interpretation of subsequent cards.

## Focus Card

You may select a single card from the deck and place it face up in the 'subject' slot of the layout. This is how you may focus your reading on something specific. So, if a player is seeking more information on, say, a powerful magic item... then it would be appropriate to select the Artifact card as the Focus.

The Focus card is always the first card laid down and, regardless of the layout used, generally sits at the heart of the layout. If you do not choose a Focus, the reading is generally less clear, but may provide insight into something you would otherwise not know to look into.

## Prophecy

The **prophecy** method of using this layout is a means of sussing out a flow of events involving a subject. It gives you a potential flow of events that can lead to a particular outcome. This is useful if your players get stuck and need some guidance on how to achieve something.

1. Subject of the reading. Can indicate how accurate the reading is going to be.
2. Refers to a relevant detail of the past that is important to this flow of events.
3. Refers to the present state of the Subject.
4. Refers to a future action that can bring about some important result.
5. Refers to the actual result that may occur if this flow is followed.

## Vibe Check

The **vibe check** method is used to gather information on the present state of a subject.

1. Subject of the reading. Can indicate how accurate the reading is going to be.
2. Refers to an important element of the Subject's past.
3. Refers to something that opposes the Subject. It can indicate anything from an active enemy, to a possible set-back, or any other 'bad thing' that involves the Subject.
4. Refers to a (possible) future of the Subject. This card is always subject to speculation as the future is not set in stone. It generally refers to an impending threat or event, rather than speaking of an 'outcome'.
5. Refers to something that is an ally, friend, or boon towards the Subject. As with card 3, this can represent anything 'good' that is related to the subject.
