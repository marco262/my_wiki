## Expenses

These are things to take out of the party funds when I remember:

## Available Plot Hooks

* Go talk to Halgraek Barrelshoulder to get troll skull
  * He wants either 500 gp or help with sabotaging his neighbor who has a nicer house than him
  * Halgraek is willing to rent out the trollskull for 10 gp/day
  * Halgraek is willing to take Gemma Arterton on as a maid as a trial run
* Harpers Mission, "Welcome to the Family"
* Tomassin asks after Emir, clearly smitten
  * Tomassin is spying on the City Watch for Emir (goings on of the Black Network, etc)
* Cecil Weiss has left tickets for them on the 11th, for Kiss of the Lamia
* Brendaniel has a mentor!

---

* Uncle David will threaten Emir when he's coming back with the treasure if he doesn't take the treasure back to his family
  * He wishes to confront Golorr itself, for... reasons?

## Things to bring up to the players

* Renaer will mention that he can get them an audience with [Laerel Silverhand](^laeral_silverhand.jpg), current Open Lord of Waterdeep.
* Level up the players after the cabin

## TODO

* Florence Ableton has two 14 and 16 year old boys
* Soundboard:
  * Add volume control
* Fill out vault
* Design Xanathar forces
* Plan David fight
