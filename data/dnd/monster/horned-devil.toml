***Multiattack.*** The devil makes three melee attacks: two with its fork and one with its tail. It can use Hurl Flame in place of any melee attack.

***Fork.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}15 ({@damage 2d8 + 6}) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 1d8 + 6}) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a {@dc 17} Constitution saving throw or lose 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 10 ({@dice 3d6}). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful {@dc 12} Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

***Hurl Flame.*** {@atk rs} {@hit 7} to hit, range 150 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 4d6}) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
