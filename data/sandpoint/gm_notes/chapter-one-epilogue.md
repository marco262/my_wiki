Ironbriar meets with Xanesha. Maybe at his office? Her home?

Xanesha: Ironbriar, it's rare for you to come calling.

Ironbriar: Vice Justice Hart's latest report confirms our suspicions. Thistletop has been raided and Nualia is dead.

Xanesha: Pity. She was an endearing little pet. Too easily given to anger for my tastes, but we all must have our hobbies.

Ironbriar: This was not a surprise, after what happened to her mentor.

Xanesha: The quasit? You put more faith in those creatures than deserved, Ironbriar.

Ironbriar: Her faith in the Mother of Monsters was substantial, Xanesha. And Nualia's grew even stronger.

Xanesha: And yet it did not save her in the end. Ah well, *c'est la vie*. At least they did us the favor of cleaning up Alaznist's stain and draining that disgusting well of its power. But certainly that's not the only reason you decided to come calling.
