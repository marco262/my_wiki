Erastus 18, 4698

Father said he was working on my birthday cake, so he let me end my studies early today. I went outside and there were some boys from the academy, they threw rocks at me and one hit me. I have a huge bruise, it bled some too. They called me a freak and laughed at me. I was crying so father says no one else is as gifted as I am and that my silver hair and violet eyes are a blessing from the goddess Desna. He said I'm an angel. 

> Establish Nualia's age in one of the earliest entries. "I'm 10 now, I don't need to be treated like a kid anymore!"

> One more entry with Nualia calling Tobyn "Father"

Kuthona 1, 4699

Master Gandethus gave us an impossible amount of work today, and I was trying to finish up when I noticed Amylee and the other girls were snickering and pointing at me, again. I did what Master Gandethus said and tried to ignore them, but they wouldn't stop. I excused myself from my studies and hid in the bathroom for a little while, but the girls had piled furniture in front of the doorway. I was locked in there all afternoon and half the night, I screamed but no one helped me. When the candle went out it was so dark, I was scared I was going to die. Mr. Stoot came by and let me out; he was making some pretty wood birds for the stairs. I'm never going back to Turandarok again. Ezakien can't make me. He's not my real dad anyway.

Pharast 10, 4700

I was walking home from the academy today, I took a shortcut past Cracktooth's tavern and a bunch of boys from school were following. The boys at school are always staring at me. They were saying disgusting things and hollering at me, it was Banny Harker I think. One of them called me a slut; I started running and dropped my work. Dad wanted to know why I was crying, but I just wanted to be alone.

> Nix this whole thing? At least swap with above, so she calls him "Dad" before the "not my real dad"

Pharast 24, 4700

The traders always gawk at me in the market, it's not my fault I'm different. I wasn't wearing my hat today, while I was picking up some things for dinner some old woman snipped off my braid with scissors. She told me that "your silver hair will bring me luck" as she walked off. I didn't know what to say, but now I have a bald patch. Amylee and her little friends are going to make fun of me, I just know it. Father told me not to go out so much, that I should spend more time praying.

> This should be old hat (no pun intended) for her by now. Forgetting the hat is a good choice.

Gozran 5, 4700

I was walking down Cliff street minding my own and about a dozen of the farmers in for the harvest started crowding around me. I just wanted to go. They started telling me to cure them of their rashes and boils, they smelled terribly. I tried to be nice, but when I said I couldn't one of them pulled my hair and started yelling in my face to cure his warts. They wanted to know when they should plant their potatoes, like how should I know. 

One of them told me I was the "blessed of Desna" and that my voice could drive away the voices he was hearing, and he was haunted by evil spirits. I screamed at them and I finally pulled away, but one of them pulled out some of my hair. They chased me all the way to the church. I locked myself in, and they were pounding on the door. Why does this keep happening?

> Spread out the time a little bit? Also, make Nualia more bitter and judgmental as time goes on.

----

Gozran 15, 4700 

Ezakien told me today that he was sending me to Windsong Abbey on my 17th birthday. He didn't even ask me. I don't want to be a nun, I love Desna, but that's not what I want. He's not letting me go out until I do perfect on the verses, catechisms, and scriptures. I'm going to spend the whole summer locked up in this church. I just want to get out of here, be like everyone else.

> Nualia is 11 at this point. Move this entry farther forward.
> Father Tobyn wanting to make her an acolyte is a good angle. But try to work in that he was still a good father.
> Nualia originally wanted to be like everyone else, but eventually she should want to be different/better than everyone else.

Calistril 3, 4701

I met a cute older Varisian boy today from Magnimar, he took me on a picnic on a cliff that overlooks the Old Light. He talked to me like I was a person, we stayed there for hours. He's the first boy who's ever talked to me like this, not staring and all weird. I might be in love. Is this what love feels like? His name is Delek Viskanta. 

> Note: Nualia is 12 at this point.

----

Calistril 29, 4701

My love threw rocks at my window and I climbed out tonight. We walked along the beach beneath the Glassworks. We found a little cave that goes back a little ways, I was a little scared at first, but we made love. Delek says that he loves me, and we will run away to Magnimar and get married. He says he has family there we can stay with, this is moving so fast, but it feels right. Desna's listening after all, thank you.

> She should have a pet name for him at this point. It should feel like a suddenly very emotionally deep relationship.
> Delek should come from a nomadic group of Varisians. He'll offer to let her travel with his family.
> Nualia should hint at her prior religious education, and she should start to "thank" and "believe in" Desna now. So that when her heart is broken, she can blame Desna later.

----

Pharast 21, 4702

Ezakien says he's going to send me away to the Windsong Abbey, he doesn't like me hanging around Delek. He says that I must remain "pure", but I think I'm pregnant. I haven't told anyone, but I'm going to tell Delek at the cave tonight when we sneak off. 

How could he?? He told me he loved me, he's leaving me, he told me he was leaving for Magnimar, and that I was nothing to him, just a whore. He told me he didn't love me, he called me a fool and a stupid girl. He walked away, what am I going to do? I can't tell Father.

> Nualia is 13. Age her up a bit.
> They should have sex for the first time in Neth 4701
> Add entry before this one about Nualia feeling morning sickness and not knowing what it is.
> This entry should instead be Father Tobyn recognizing the signs of her being pregnant, grounding her, and threatening to send her to the Abbey.

----

> New entry: Nualia sneaks out to see Delek and tell him the good news.
> Hasty addendum, with tear spots on the paper: Nualia adds about how Delek turned her down and broke up with her.

----

Pharast 22, 4702

Father yelled at me again, he called me a harlot and told me to go pray to Desna. I stayed at the altar for 3 hours, and she didn't answer me. Desna doesn't care about me, she thinks I'm worthless too, why did he do this to me. Delek, why do I still love you? I hate you.

----

Desnus 2, 4702

I'm so angry. I don't know what's come over me. Everyone's been so mean lately, I've been having such weird dreams, and they're terrifying. Father won't let me go out, he says it's because of the Chopper, but I know he's ashamed of me. Mother goddess Desna if you're here, I'm listening, just make the pain go away.

> Good note. Definitely give her fucked up dreams as the baby inside her is corrupted by Lamashtu, via Nualia's anger. Have this last for a month, then she has her miscarriage.

----

Desnus 23, 4702

I finally snuck out of the church tonight, I just had to get out. It was dark and I saw Mr. Stoot, he had dropped a few of his carved birds and they had shattered. I helped him pick them up, he told me that I was still beautiful to him and that I shouldn't go out after dark, it isn't safe. I stayed at the Cave for a few hours, like Delek and I used to do.

> Good note.

----

Sarenith 26, 4702

They killed Mr. Stoot. They said he was the Chopper. They said he killed Mrs. Deverin's fiancÃ© and cut off his arm. I can see his house burning from the top window of the church. Mr. Stoot would never have hurt anyone, how can they do that to him, he was always so nice to me.

I keep having these dreams. I don't feel well at all, I think the baby knows I'm upset.

> Whose arm got cut off? Look into this.
> This should be a breaking point for Nualia's hatred of the people of Sandpoint.

----

Sarenith 27, 4702

Something is wrong. I'm so sick, something is wrong with the baby. There's blood, it's too soon, it's only been 5 months. I saw Father talking to that butcher Hannah. I don't want to lose my baby. Father won't even look at me, what is he doing talking to her! Desna please make the pain go away, save my baby, please. I'll never do anything bad again.

> Journal stops here. Summarize the rest of her life. Make sure to mention the Skinsaw Men to drop hints for next chapter.
> Good note to beg Desna to save her baby.
