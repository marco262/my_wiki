Below you'll find a collection of rules that are commonly used in all my campaigns. If you have any questions about this rule, feel free to ask me.

### Adventurers' Intuition

One of the best things about D&D is it gives players the opportunity to take on the role of an adventurer in a fictional world. However, just because someone is playing an experienced adventurer doesn't mean they have all the skills, experience, knowledge, and intuition of that adventurer themselves. This is usually managed in the game by things like Strength (Athletics) or Intelligence (History) skill checks. But in the course of choosing what your character does in a given situation, you may find that lack of experience becomes a problem.

If you are ever in a situation where you don't know what to do or what the right course of action is, you may ask me (the DM) if you can make an Intuition roll. This usually takes the form of a Wisdom (Insight) check, but I may ask for other rolls at my discretion. If your roll succeeds, I will provide you with a hint or a flash of insight or something to help you get unstuck or give you an idea of the best course of action.

### Exploration Activities

When the party is exploring a dungeon, traveling through the wilderness, or doing anything else that doesn't place them in combat, I may ask everyone to pick an [Exploration Activity](/dnd/general/Exploration Activities) that they're performing during that time. See the linked page for more detail. 

### Potions of Healing

You can drink a [Potion of Healing](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/Potion of Healing) either as an action or as a bonus action. If you drink the potion as a bonus action, you quickly dump the potion into your mouth, possibly wasting some of it as it splashes on you or your surroundings. Roll for the total healing the potion does as normal.

If you drink the potion as an action, the potion does the maximum possible amount of healing it's capable of. For example, a [Potion of Superior Healing](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/Potion of Healing) normally does 8d4 + 8 healing, but if you drink it as an action you will heal 8 Ã— 4 + 8 = 40 hit points.

This rule may also apply to other potions that require a die roll to determine their effect, at my discretion.

### Uncommon Spells

In a world of magic spells, some spells will naturally be more well-known than others. There are some spells that every arcanist knows of and can easily learn, like [Prestidigitation](/dnd/spell/Prestidigitation) or [Magic Missile](/dnd/spell/Magic Missile). But there are other spells that, even though they may be low level, many magic users don't even know exist.

When you are preparing your spells in the morning, or picking spells to learn/swap when you're leveling up, all spells from the Player's Handbook (PHB) are fair game. Any non-PHB spell, however, requires some kind of explanation for why your character knows of and has access to it. This rule is not intended to limit the spells you have access to, but rather to keep some spells in the game feeling unique and special. If you wish to pick a non-PHB spell, let me know, and we will work together to come up with an explanation for how you know this spell. 

You can view all the spells available to you in the [Spell Filter](/dnd/spell_filter), and you can use that to filter them by their sourcebook.
