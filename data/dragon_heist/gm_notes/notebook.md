## Available Plot Hooks

* Go talk to Halgraek Barrelshoulder to get troll skull
  * He wants either 500 gp or help with sabotaging his neighbor who has a nicer house than him
  * Halgraek is willing to rent out the trollskull for 10 gp/day
  * Halgraek is willing to take Gemma Arterton on as a maid as a trial run
* Doom Raiders Mission, "On Dasher"
  * Blossom Snobeedle has offered 750gp to "scare Dasher straight"
  * Dasher will pretend to be "scared straight", and will come home to his mother. Then, a few days later, he'll be "killed" by a pack of wild dogs.
* Harpers Mission, "Welcome to the Family"
* Tomassin asks after Emir, clearly smitten
  * Tomassin is spying on the City Watch for Emir (goings on of the Black Network, etc)
* Grinda Garloth has offered 100gp if they find where her family's bodies were taken.
* Looking for a mentor for Brendaniel. Ulkoria will find a Draconic Sorcerer to tutor Brendaniel

---

* Uncle David will threaten Emir when he's coming back with the treasure if he doesn't take the treasure back to his family

## TODO
