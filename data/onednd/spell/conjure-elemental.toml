description = """
You summon an Elemental spirit that fills a 10- foot Cube within range. The spirit lasts for the duration and is composed of air, earth, fire, or water (your choice) when you cast this spell.

When a creature hostile to you [[glossary:Move|Moves]] within 5 feet of the spirit, you can make a melee spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 8d8 damage of a type determined by the spirit's element: Bludgeoning (earth), Cold (water), Fire (fire), or Lightning (air). If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is also pulled into the Cube and has the Restrained condition. At the start of each of its turns, the target must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the target frees itself. On a failure, the target takes 4d8 damage of the same type as the spell attack. The spirit can have only one creature restrained at a time.
