A Beast Master ranger forms a mystical bond with a special beast, drawing on primal magic and a deep attunement to the natural world.

### 3rd Level: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Choose its stat block -- Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky -- which uses your Proficiency Bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its supernatural origin.

In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a Bonus Action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the [[glossary:Attack]] action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you have the [[glossary:Incapacitated]] condition, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the beast has died within the last hour, you can you use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can summon a different primal beast. The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears. The beast vanishes if you die.

### 7th Level: Exceptional Training

When you use your Bonus Action to command your Primal Companion beast to take an action, you can also command it to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or [[glossary:Help]] action as a Bonus Action.

In addition, whenever the beast hits with an attack and deals damage, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

### 11th Level: Bestial Fury

When you command your Primal Companion beast to take the [[glossary:Attack]] action, the beast can make two attacks.

In addition, the first time each turn it hits a creature under the effect of your _[[[spell:Hunter's Mark]]]_ spell, the beast deals extra Force damage equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

### 15th Level: Share Spells

When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your Primal Companion beast with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.
