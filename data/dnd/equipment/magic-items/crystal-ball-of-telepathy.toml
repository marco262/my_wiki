description = """
The typical _crystal ball_, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the _[scrying](/dnd/spell/scrying)_ spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following _crystal ball_ variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While _[scrying](/dnd/spell/scrying)_ with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the _[suggestion](/dnd/spell/suggestion)_ spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this _[suggestion](/dnd/spell/suggestion)_ to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if _[scrying](/dnd/spell/scrying)_ ends. Once used, the _[suggestion](/dnd/spell/suggestion)_ power of the _crystal ball_ can't be used again until the next dawn.
