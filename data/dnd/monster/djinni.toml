***Scimitar.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 9} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) slashing damage plus 3 ({@damage 1d6}) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures {@condition restrained} by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature {@condition restrained} by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a {@dc 18} Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer {@condition restrained} and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
