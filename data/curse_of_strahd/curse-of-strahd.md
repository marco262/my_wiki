# Campaign Synopsis

> Under raging storm clouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. Count Strahd von Zarovich stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness. Lighting splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. His once handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself. Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his ken, guests have arrived in his domain. Strahd's face forms a twisted smile, for he knows why they have come. Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle's towers, but Strahd is gone. Only the howling wind, or perhaps a lone wolf,fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner, and you are invited!

[[accordion Intro]]

## What is Curse of Strahd?

In short, classic gothic horror and dread in a medieval Romanian setting.This is first and foremost a campaign of dread, a genre that requires players to willingly immerse into, at times,feelings of terror and hopelessness,without the use of dice or checks. Even the best lighting, music, and atmosphere cannot change the fact players are around a table with plenty of distractions. As such, the game begins in the style of play you bring to the table, and the more you bring, the more rewarding the campaign.

## What is Dread?

It is the clock ticking down to the inevitable end. With each tock, you are dragged forward, no more able to avoid your fate than to stop the beating of your own heart. It is being trapped in the nightmare, knowing it doesn't matter where you run because it never stops, and trying to run even as your legs become heavy as concrete, knowing all you can do is wait to be destroyed. It is the mix of metallic copper fear on your tongue, an acute awareness of every beat of your heart, and the feeling your lungs cannot fill no matter how deep a breath you take. Use these feelings to envision how your characters feel at times. This Land you are about to enter will gladly let you drown in feelings of inevitability, of hopelessness. It will, if you let it, crush you with the knowledge that in this place, there are no happy endings, no heroes, no fires to banish the night. Yet, fear and dread can be countered with hope, and perhaps you will be the mortals that challenge, even if for a moment, this Evil.
