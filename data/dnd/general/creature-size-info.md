This page's intended purpose is to combine information about all the different rules of for creature size into one place.

# Creature Size
<sup>*Source: Player's Handbook, p. 191; Monsters Manual, p. 6*</sup>

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

**Size Categories**
||~ Size ||~ Space ||~ Examples ||
|| Tiny || 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft || Imp, sprite ||
|| Small || 5 by 5 ft || Giant rat, goblin ||
|| Medium || 5 by 5 ft || Orc, werewolf ||
|| Large || 10 by 10 ft || Hippogriff, ogre ||
|| Huge || 15 by 15 ft || Fire giant, treant ||
|| Gargantuan || 20 by 20 ft or larger || Kraken, purple worm ||

## Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dim ensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crow d around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

## Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.

# Creature Size on Squares and Hexes
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 251*</sup>
[[f<image monster_sizes_map.png size="medium"]]
A creature's size determines how much space it occupies on squares or hexes, as shown in the Creature Size and Space table. If the miniature you use for a monster takes up an amount of space different from what's on the table, that's fine, but treat the monster as its official size for all other rules. For example, you might use a miniature that has a Large base to represent a Huge giant. That giant takes up less space on the battlefield than its size suggests, but it is still Huge for the purposes of rules like grappling.

**Creature Size and Space**
||~ Size ||~ Space: Squares ||~ Space: Hexes ||
|| Tiny || 4 per square || 4 per hex ||
|| Small || 1 square || 1 hex ||
|| Medium || 1 square || 1 hex ||
|| Large || 4 squares (2 by 2) || 3 hexes ||
|| Huge || 9 squares (3 by 3) || 7 hexes ||
|| Gargantuan || 16 squares (4 by 4) or more || 12 hexes or more ||

# Monster Hit Dice
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 276; Monsters Manual, p. 6*</sup>

Alternatively, you can assign a number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its average hit points. Don't worry if the hit points aren't matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always adjust a monster's Hit Dice and hit points later on.

A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want, but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points depends on the monster's size, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d8s for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice and a Constitution of 13 (+1 modifier) has 5d8 + 5 hit points.

A monster typically has average hit points based on its Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit points has an average of 27 hit points (5 x 4.5 + 5).

**Hit Dice by Size**
||~ Monster Size ||~ Hit Die ||~ Average HP per Die ||
|| Tiny || d4 || 2 1/2 ||
|| Small || d6 || 3 1/2 ||
|| Medium || d8 || 4 1/2 ||
|| Large || d10 || 5 1/2 ||
|| Huge || d12 || 6 1/2 || 
|| Gargantuan || d20 || 10 1/2 ||

# Food and Water Needs by Creature Size
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 251*</sup>

Horses and other creatures require different quantities of food and water per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if the weather is hot.

||~ Creature Size ||~ Food per Day ||~ Water per Day ||
|| Tiny || 1/4 pound || 1/4 gallon ||
|| Small || 1 pound || 1 gallon ||
|| Medium || 1 pound || 1 gallon ||
|| Large || 4 pounds || 4 gallons ||
|| Huge || 16 pounds || 16 gallons ||
|| Gargantuan || 64 pounds || 16 gallons ||

# Object Sizes
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 247*</sup>

**Hit Points.** An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.

**Object Hit Points**
||~ Size ||~ Fragile ||~ Resilient ||
|| Tiny (bottle, lock) || 2 (1d4) || 5 (2d4) ||
|| Small (chest, lute) || 3 (1d6) || 10 (3d6) ||
|| Medium (barrel, chandelier) || 4 (1d8) || 18 (4d8) ||
|| Large (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window) || 5 (1d10) || 27 (5d10) ||

**Huge and Gargantuan Objects.** Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.

# Climb onto a Bigger Creature
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 271*</sup>

If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A Small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space and clings to its body. While in the target's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action -- knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it -- by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

# Base Damage of Monster Weapons
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 278*</sup>

Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan. For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately sized greataxe deals 3d12 slashing damage (plus its Strength bonus), instead of the normal d12.

A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes larger is too big for the creature to use at all.

# Magic Items
<sup>*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 140*</sup>

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Many magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

Rare exceptions exist. If the story suggests a good reason for an item to fit only creatures of a certain size or shape, you can rule that it doesn't adjust. For example, armor made by the drow might fit elves only.
