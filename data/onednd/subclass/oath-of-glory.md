**Tenets of Glory**

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Glory vary, Paladins of this oath share these tenets.

***Actions over Words.*** Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.

***Challenges Are but Tests.*** Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.

***Hone the Body.*** Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.

***Discipline the Soul.*** You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.

Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions, so they're all ready when destiny calls.

### 3rd Level: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

#### Oath of Devotion Spells

### 3rd Level: Inspiring Smite

Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with any of your Paladin's Smite spells, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and distribute Temporary Hit Points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, which can include you. The total number of Temporary Hit Points equals 2d8 + your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

### 3rd Level: Peerless Athlete

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For 1 hour, you have Advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

### 7th Level: Aura of Alacrity

Your Speed increases by 10 feet, and the Speed of any ally who starts their turn in your Aura of Protection increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

### 15th Level: Glorious Defense

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this Reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### 20th Level: Living Legend

You can empower yourself with the legends -- whether true or exaggerated -- of your great deeds. As a Bonus Action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

**Charismatic.** You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining Advantage on all Charisma checks.  
**Saving Throw Reroll.** If you fail a saving throw, you can use your Reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.  
**Unerring Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of it by expending a 5th-level spell slot (no action required).
