[Meanwhile in Magnimar...](^sandpoint/meanwhile_in_magnimar.jpg)

_Meanwhile, in [an opulent office](^sandpoint/xaneshas_office.jpg) somewhere in Magnimar, the setting sun is shining through tall windows framed by heavy curtains. The deep red light illuminates a woman in a plush, velvet chair as she sips at a glass of expensive wine. A man enters, neither knocking nor announcing himself. The woman addresses him without looking at him._

**Woman:** You're late.

**Man:** My apologies, my lady. I had to step out on official business. Though your visits are always a welcome distraction.

**Woman:** Always so quick with the excuses and the flattery. You're lucky you're so good at both. What news of our plans?

_The man settles into a chair beside the woman, taking a second wineglass from a side table that has already been filled._

**Man:** Vice Justice Hart's latest report confirms our suspicions. Thistletop has been raided and the aasimar is dead.

**Woman:** Pity. She was an endearing little pet. Too easily given to anger for my tastes, but we all must have our hobbies.

**Man:** This was not a surprise, after what happened to her mentor.

**Woman:** The quasit? You put more faith in that creature than she deserved, pet.

**Man:** Her faith in the Mother of Monsters was substantial. And Nualia's grew even stronger.

**Woman:** And yet it did not save her in the end. Ah well, *c'est la vie*. At least they did us the favor of cleaning up Alaznist's stain and draining that disgusting well of its power. That little town has been a nasty little incubator for Wrathful souls for too long.

**Man:** It has not been entirely a thorn in our side. Did you not send off your new project on his mission?

**Woman:** Hah! Oh yes, I *tingle* with anticipation for his results. He was already quite far gone before I sent him off on his little errand, and we should be receiving news of further progress within the week. That is, if he can accomplish a few simple murders without proper supervision.

_The woman sets down her wineglass, finally turning to look at the man seated beside her._

**Woman:** And what of the Brothers?

**Man:** Business as usual, my lady. We continue to act at your pleasure, and the harvest proceeds apace. I anticipate another three score souls before the month's end.

_The woman cackles with glee, putting her hand on the man's arm._

**Woman:** Wonderful! You never cease to please, pet.

_The man smiles, picking up the woman's hand and raising to his lips to kiss her knuckles reverently._

**Man:** I live for your pleasure, my lady.

_The woman smiles coyly, purring her approval._

**Woman:** And such a pleasure you are.
