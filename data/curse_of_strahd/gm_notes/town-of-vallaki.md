# Events

## Meeting with Jared

When the players hunker down in their rooms for the night, someone will notice a [candle](^curse_of_strahd/candle.jpg) dancing, and they get the distinct impression it's beckoning them. When they get close enough, they'll see the candle occasionally flickers to the humanoid form, and they can hear Uncle David's voice, as if from a great distance or through weak radio signal telling them to "Find the dollmaker and have him make a doll of oak, ash, and thorn. Then when the moon is high, tie this ribbon around the doll and follow it." The candle will snuff out, and a small piece of purple ribbon will fall to the floor/table.

Blinsky will tell them he has some oak on hand, but will need them to find the ash and the thorn. If they get stumped on where to find either of them, they will hear Rictavio or the Vistani singing [this song]($load|youtube|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr1CM_yw68c). The singer will tell them it's an old song, and it tells of three types of wood who have an arcane power when used together. They may also be able to point the players in the right direction to find some more. "Thorn" can refer to any trees with thorny leaves. (If they talk to Vistani, the Vistani will try to convince the players to get drunk, and sell them trinkets)

Once they get the [doll](^curse_of_strahd/twig_blight.jpg) and tie the bow around it, it will jump out of their hands and race off into the forest. It will find a small clearing in the moonlight, and bury itself in the loam. After a few moments, a sapling will sprout and quickly grow to a fruit tree. A [fruit](^curse_of_strahd/everapple.jpg) will grow heavy on a branch, hanging down towards the nearest player. The fruit will split open to reveal a tiny [Lord Jared](^lord_jared.jpg). He has a few bits of information:

Flashback to Erwaren's Rest: The party has been missing for days now, ask the players what they've been doing in the meantime. Uncle David will show up and tell them he's found the missing party, but they're trapped in a pocket dimension, and he cannot get to them. But he thinks he'll be able to get any news or information to them.

* The players are trapped in Barovia
* He can't travel there because it is beyond his "domain"
* (Answer any questions they may have here)
* As they are ready to leave, he tells them to keep a look out for any spot that weakens the barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead
* Right before they leave, he'll call them back and say he forgot, but he has some gifts for them...

Flashback again: Uncle David says he can deliver three items to them that might help them on their quest. They cannot be very powerful (no better than Uncommon). Let the players pick three items, and then the tree grows three more fruits which contain the magic items.

When Lord Jared says goodbye, his tiny body turns into honey and flows over the ground/someone's hand. The tree quickly shrivels and dies until it's just a husk, its magic expended. 

## Missing Vistana

* [Quest Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EbCatMMviZfxQy1Ldh9Rk3Rez_J70yI0UJG8gSrnbw/view#heading=h.w6irt8m66qdy)
* [Lada](^curse_of_strahd/orphan.jpg), orphan at St. Andral's

## Cursed Orphanage

* [Ludmilla Vilisevic](^curse_of_strahd/ludmilla_vilisevic.jpg)
* [Claudia Belasco](^curse_of_strahd/claudia_belasco.jpg), matron of the orphanage
* [Felix](^curse_of_strahd/felix.jpg), an orphan at St. Andral's, being impersonated by a [maurezhi](^curse_of_strahd/maurezhi.jpg) ([stats](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#maurezhi_mtf))

## Lady Wachter's Wish

Lady Fiona Wachter sends Ernst Larnak to invite the PCs to dine with her. Her goal in this dinner is to convince the PCs she needs their help, and to have them look into what Victor did to Stella to destroy her mind. She has a good idea already, but she wants the PCs to discover it for themselves, so she can use this as emotional leverage to convince the PCs to help her in her coup against Baron Vallakovich.

## Tyger, Tyger

[Quest Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EbCatMMviZfxQy1Ldh9Rk3Rez_J70yI0UJG8gSrnbw/view#heading=h.dns09xlressa)

The PCs are in the Blue Water Inn when they hear screams coming from outside to the East. If they follow the screams, they'll be lead to the Town Square. Here, they'll see [Izek Strazni](^curse_of_strahd/izek_strazni.jpg) and a bunch of guards questioning some freaked out villagers. Izek will come over and question the PCs and order them to stay indoors. A good insight check will notice that his gaze is lingering longer on Ireena than anyone else.  

People in general are in a panick, either packing up their carts, hurrying home, or standing around trying to understand what's going on. 

If the PCs ask around, they'll eventually come across Rictavio who is also trying to question people where the tiger went, though attempting to be discreet about it. He'll be evasive around the party unless someone references they know who he is. He'll offer to tell them all he knows, if they will find the tiger before the guards do and stop it from coming to harm. He mentions that the tiger has been trained to hunt down Vistani, both by their smell and their colorful clothes. He'll then attempt to split ways with the party to try and find the tiger on his own.

The PCs will need to accomplish a skill challenge to find the tiger. Refer to the quest description for the rest of the quest.
