## Origin

The Mad Mage of Mount Baratok is actually Mordenkainen, who arrived in Barovia a year ago. He gathered together a collection of villagers and convinced them to rise up against Strahd, to act as a distraction as he tried to infiltrate Strahd's castle to find the source of Strahd's power and possibly steal powerful artifacts for himself. But he was ambushed by Khazan, a lich in Strahd's employ. They battled each other in the depths of Strahd's castle while Strahd put down the rebellion, and Mordenkainen pulled out a decisive but costly victory. However, this victory was short-lived as Strahd arrived shortly after, and Mordenkainen was forced to retreat. 

Strahd followed Mordenkainen, and the two fought over Tser Falls. The final blow was struck when Mordenkainen launched a Feeblemind spell at Strahd, but the vampire was rocking an awesome defensive spell from Khazan that turned the spell back on Mordenkainen. Mordenkainen's jade circlet, which was meant to protect him from enchantment effects and enable his Shapechange spell, was damaged in the fight and rather than protecting him completely, it instead shattered his mind into multiple personalities. He plummeted into the falls, dropping his spellbook and his staff, and Strahd decided to just leave him for dead.

## Mad Mage

The Mad Mage currently roams Mount Baratok, shifting between various different magical beast forms. Each form represents a different aspect of his personality. All are aggressive and cannot be reasoned with, except for his [Pseudodragon](^curse_of_strahd/pseudodragon.jpg) form which he takes when he's startled or scared. The pseudodragon has only a shred of the intelligence of the original man, and is more likely to babble and beg for its life than have a conversation. 

Each form also wears a [jade circlet](^curse_of_strahd/jade_circlet.jpg) which, if removed, breaks the protection of the circlet. If this happens, Mordenkainen has a few moments of lucidity before he becomes a drooling, powerless idiot.

## Fixing Him

If the players manage to talk to the pseudodragon, or Mordenkainen himself after the circlet is removed, he'll ask them to find his spellbook which carries a simulacrum his consciousness, and if he's reunited with it, it has failsafes in it that will restore his mind.

## Spellbook

Mordenkainen's spellbook is in the possession of Victor Vallakovich, who found it on the shore of Lake Baratok a year ago. Although he knows it holds great power (a simple detect magic spell proves this), it's closed tight with an arcane lock that Victor has yet to be able to break. If the arcane lock is removed or bypassed somehow, the book activates a beacon that gives off a glow and an otherworldly note that can be seen and heard for miles away. This will draw the Mad Mage to wherever it is from all over Barovia, and woe betide anyone in his way.

If the book is brought to Van Richten's Tower, the arcane lock and beacon are disabled and the book can be opened, though its contents are little more than a curiosity to anyone other than another wizard who can decipher Mordenkainen's magical notation. When the book is removed from the tower's anti-magic field, its arcane lock will reactivate and reseal the book. However, if the book is open when it's removed, the beacon will activate instead.

## Staff

TBD

## Jade Circlet

If removed from the Mad Mage's head, the jade circlet is still irreparably damaged, but it has enough lingering magic to be useful to anyone who might attune to it. Whoever attunes to the circlet gains the ability to activate the circlet as an action. When they do, they change into a random monster per the _[shapechange](/dnd/spell/shapechange)_ spell. The monster must be between CR 1 and CR 12, monstrous in appearance, and one of the following types: aberration, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, or monstrosity. So the circlet can turn a creature into an abominable yeti or an earth elemental, but not a deva or bone devil.
