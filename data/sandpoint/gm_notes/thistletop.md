As the party sets out from Sandpoint towards Thistletop, have them roll a Perception check (DC 15-20). Depending on how well they roll, they get ambushed and an arrow hits a tree near someone's head. The attacker turns out to be [Shalelu Andosana](^sandpoint/shalelu_andosana.jpg), who was firing a warning shot just to get their attention. :)

She'll lead the party the rest of the way to Thistletop, explaining everything she knows about Thistletop, including the brambles and the hidden entrances, and the druid hanging about. She'll let them know about the Birdcruncher goblin refugees, and how she knows they're being regularly fed to something called the Howling Hole, but she hasn't delved far enough into the brambles to find out more.

As the party is getting ready to delve into the map, they'll hear the sound of a goblin hunting party approaching in the distance. Shalelu will break off and promise to distract the hunting party while the PCs move in.

### Dungeon Level 1

> Although goblins can see in the dark, several of Nualia's followers cannot, and so hooded lanterns hang in each hallway and in most rooms throughout the complex; these lanterns are generally left lit only during daylight hours. Ceiling height averages 8 feet in most rooms, and doors are generally rickety wooden affairs rigged by the goblins. 

* D1: [Abandoned Feast Hall](^sandpoint/thistletop/abandoned_feast_hall.jpg)
* D2: [Chieftain's Harem](^sandpoint/thistletop/chieftains_harem.jpg)

      * Flail property: If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.
      * Loot: Studded leather, flail, longbow with arrows, [Boots of False Tracks](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/boots-of-false-tracks), 20 gp
  * 4x [Goblin wives](^sandpoint/thistletop/goblin_wife.png)
* D3: [Goblin Nursery](^sandpoint/thistletop/goblin_nursery.jpg)
  * [Goblin baby](^sandpoint/thistletop/goblin_baby.jpg), [Goblin child](^sandpoint/thistletop/goblin_child.jpg), [Goblin baby (terrifying)](^sandpoint/thistletop/goblin_baby_terrifying.jpg)
  * [Trapped Mouse](^sandpoint/thistletop/trapped_mouse.jpg) in a tiny cage, actually [Gogmurt](^sandpoint/thistletop/gogmurt.jpg) wildshaped ([[npc cr=2|race=Goblin|role=Healer|weapon=Flame Blade]])
  * What Gogmurt thinks of the goings-on in Thistletop:
      * Thistletop is an ancient home to a goblin god named "Malfeshnekor" who speaks only to the wisest and bravest and important goblins. 
      * Malfeshnekor has not spoken to Ripnugget, which got a lot of goblins killed when they pointed it out.
      * Gogmurt can feel his presence underneath Thistletop, and is drawn to the place like goblin shamans have been for years and years and years.
      * Ripnugget was enchanted by skinny, white-haired longshanks (Nualia), and is being all stupid gooey-headed and dragging the whole tribe down with him.
      * Nualia claims Malfeshnekor speaks directly to her. Stupid! Stupid and false! Malfeshnekor only speaks to goblins, and only in thoughts and feelings and dreams.
      * Gogmurt doesn't trust Nualia, but Ripnugget nearly had him killed for saying so.
      * He was slinking around the area, spying on the other longshanks Nualia showed up with, but was captured by Lyrie one day who just put him on a shelf in the nursery to starve.
      * Gogmurt wants Ripnugget dead, and will be thrilled to learn he's gone. 
      * He wants the PCs to leave Thistletop alone, and will tolerate their presence just long enough for them to kill Nualia and the other longshanks.
      * If asked to help fight, he will "agree" if he thinks it will get the party to move on and kill his enemies, but will always find and excuse to stay back and do nothing.
* D4a: [Tsuto's Chambers](^sandpoint/thistletop/tsutos_chambers.png)
  * [Tsuto Kaijitsu](^sandpoint/thistletop/tsuto_kaijitsu_burned.jpg) ([[npc cr=3|name=Tsuto|race=Half-elf|role=Skirmisher|weapon=Shortbow or Unarmed Strike|num_attacks=+1|hp=40]])

### Dungeon Level 2

> Cracks line the walls here and there, and while the first few rooms are fairly clean, dust and rubble clutter areas **E6-E10**. Spiderwebs clutter the corners of the rooms. Areas **E1-E4** are lit by lanterns left on the floor by Nualia and her minions, but areas **E5-E10** are unlit unless otherwise indicated.
> 
> This entire level is sloped downward toward the west, though it doesn't appreciably impact movement. Air quality in these chambers is surprisingly good, and the temperature never varies from a comfortable 60° F. _Detect magic_ reveals this as a faint transmutation aura.
