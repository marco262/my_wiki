Dreams of death and destruction have plagued your psyche, severe enough that it has affected you throughout life. But you have cause to believe that there may be more to your condition than what it seems. You must seek answers.


- **Proficiencies and Languages:** *Special*. Whenever you attempt a skill, use a tool, or try to comprehend a language you are not already proficient with, you gain that proficiency on a natural 20 roll. You must finish a long rest before another proficiency is gained this way. Once you have five proficiencies, you no longer gain more.
- **Equipment:** a set of common clothes, a shard of pure crystal, a journal, and a belt pouch containing 500 gil

## Recurring Dream
Choose from the table, or roll a d6 to determine the event haunting your dreams. You may also choose to work with your DM to create an entirely different dream.

| d6  | A Dream of...                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A once blue sky set aflame as meteorites rain down. Terrible beasts manifest out of thin air and rend untold havoc amongst the terrified and fleeing populace.  |
|  2  | The very land itself at first beginning to tremble, then shake, and then quake violently. So much so, even mountains are not spared. All is swallowed by earth. |
|  3  | A city of stone standing in a forested clearing, but festering with rot and decay. The forces of nature then quickly close in and smother the city completely.  |
|  4  | A proud city rapidly being consumed by rising flood waters. Overhead, a gargantuan, alien vessel ascends into the sky, vanishing through the dark cloud cover.  |
|  5  | A riverside hamlet beset by fire breathing dragons. Hyur and Elezen men desperately scramble to mount a defense using nothing but their farming equipment.      |
|  6  | A bloody feud between the Matron and the Destroyer. After much death, both the Navigator and the Twins together take up arms and rush to Her defense.           |

## Feature: Etched Upon Your Very Soul
As a proficiency is gained with this feature, you once again experience your dream, but new details emerge for the first time. Work with your DM as to what these new details are, and any subsequent developments as a result. 

Once all proficiencies have been granted, you are able to create an echo of those memories onto a shard of crystal. The crystal functions similarly to a soul crystal, telling the events of the dream from your perspective. Others may attune to the crystal and view the events themselves.

## Suggested Characteristics
You are on a journey of self discovery. Do your dreams haunt you, or continue to push you onward? Perhaps they do not motivate you at all, preferring to simply wander the world in deep reflection, finding the answer yourself.
