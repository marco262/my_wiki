description = "<p>This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with <em>oil of slipperiness.</em> When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.</p><p>One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of <em>universal solvent</em> or <em>oil of etherealness</em>, or with a <em>wish</em> spell.</p>"
