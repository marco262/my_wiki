## Investigator
You relentlessly seek the truth. Perhaps you're motivated by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belief in the law and a sense of universal justice, or maybe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that very law has failed you and you seek to make things &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right. You could have witnessed something remarkable or terrible, and now you must know more about this hidden truth. Or maybe you're a detective for hire, uncovering secrets for well-paying clients. Whether the mysteries you're embroiled in are local crimes or realm-spanning conspiracies, you're driven by a personal need to hunt down even the most elusive clues and reveal what others would keep hidden in the shadows.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from among Insight, Investigation, or Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Disguise kit, thieves' tools
- **Equipment:** A magnifying glass, evidence from a past case (choose one or roll for a trinket from the Horror Trinkets table) a set of common clothes, and 10gp.

### Feature: Official Inquiry
&nbsp;&nbsp;You're experienced at gaining access to people and places to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.

### Path to Mystery
Your first case influenced the types of mysteries you're interested in. Why was this case so impactful, personal, or &nbsp;&nbsp;traumatic? Whom did it affect besides you? Why and how did you get involved? Was it solved? How did it set you on the path to investigating other mysteries? Roll on or choose &nbsp;&nbsp;details from the First Case table on the next page to develop the mystery that started your career as an investigator.

### Suggested Characteristics
The keen mind of an investigator thinks in ways most others don't. This can often lead to them having personality traits that, though can be subtle, make them uniquely memorable to those they work with. The job is very demanding and the loyalty needed forms ideals of strong work ethics and perseverance while creating strong bonds that shape the way they think, sometimes exacerbating a peculiar flaw.

| d8  | Personality Trait |
|:----:|:-----------|
|  1  | While deep in thought I subconsciously make unusual noises that I don't notice, but others find quite irritating.  |
|  2  | I am a creature of habit and have a routine for going about everything I do. |
|  3  | I find the smell and/or sight of a simple everyday item appalling. |

|  8  | When confronted with a math problem, I am not satisfied with the answer until I have proven it multiple ways.  |

| d6  | Ideal |
|:----:|:-----------|
|  1  | **Professional.** Your word is only as good as your results. If you say you'll get a job done, you get the job done. (Lawful) |
|  2  | **Charity.** Everyone needs a hand from time to time. Who am I to deny that help to a person in need? (Good) |
|  3  | **Employment.** I don't care what the job is, as long as it pays well. (Neutral) |
|  4  | **Focused.** If it doesn't have to do with me or my case, it's not my business. (Neutral) |
|  5  | **Curiosity.** I gave up detective work, but I can't help but get wrapped up in a good mystery when I hear one. (Any) |
|  6  | **Ego.** My talents as the *best* investigator in Eorzea would be wasted if I didn't use them. (Chaotic) |

|:----:|:-----------|
|  1  | Long ago, I experienced a strange phenomenon that I can't explain. I keep my eyes open for answers wherever I go. |
|  2  | A mistake I made on a job got a close partner of mine killed. I do everything now to try to make up for it. |
|  3  | Working a job keeps my mind off of other things, so of course I work all the time. |
|  4  | Once, I saved a little girl from a summoning. When her arms wrapped around me, I understood why I did the work I did. |
|  5  | I let a suspect get away, leaving me injured in the process. I swore I would have my revenge, and I'm still trying to find them. |
|  6  | My partner is my best friend and confidant. I don't know what I'd do without them. |

|  4  | I constantly play with things and fidget, and find it impossible to sit still. |
|  5  | While on a job, I was trapped inside a burning building. Now fire scares me, and the smell of smoke makes me uncomfortable and anxious. |
|  6  | My mind spins off on connections constantly. Sometimes I leave people behind in a conversation. |
