description = """You attempt to inflame strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. Choose one of the following options, which each target experiences on a failed save.

You can make targets feel a sudden surge of a single emotion while the spell lasts. Each target feels either anger, uncertainty, sadness, joy, disgust, shock, trust, anticipation, shame, lust, pity, or another emotion of your choice. The DM determines how each creature's actions are influenced by the emotion.

Alternatively, you can choose for each target to be [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]], [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]], or hostile toward one creature of your choice that it can see or hear until the spell ends. Each creature still has control over its actions and is not forced to take any particular action such as fighting or fleeing, but this effect may still influence its actions. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

When the spell ends on a creature, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a success, it is aware that its emotions were influenced by the spell. Otherwise, the creature remains unaware of the spell's effect."""
