***Multiattack.*** The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d10 + 6}) piercing damage.

***Constrict.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 10} to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. {@h}17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) bludgeoning damage plus 17 ({@damage 2d10 + 6}) slashing damage. The target is {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 16}) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is {@condition restrained} until this grapple ends.

***Lightning Breath {@recharge 5}.*** The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 ({@damage 12d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.
