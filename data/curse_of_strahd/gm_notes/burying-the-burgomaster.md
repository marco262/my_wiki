As per tradition of the Morninglord, the burial rites must be performed all night, and the body is buried in the graveyard at first light. The body is taken into a side room, where Donavich (and probably Ireena) stay all night.

At midnight, a knock sounds at the church doors. Ismark warns the players not to answer it. 

After the third round of knocks go unanswered, there's a powerful gust of wind completely throwing the doors wide open and smashing the barricade. The sudden squall extinguishes the candlelight plunging the church into darkness. The wind continues until Ismark and a PC force their way against the wind (DC 10 Strength Check) and close the doors.

Once the doors are closed, the candles spring back to life and Strahd is sitting on the altar. "Am I too late to pay my respects?"

Strahd chats with the party, dropping hints he's been watching them, and talks about "all the fun they'll have together". He's unconcerned that the PCs will manage to successfully protect Ireena from him. 

Eventually, he departs as a blood-red mist, his laughter echoing the whole time.

Once his laughter dies away, there's pounding at the door as zombies and wolves try to get in.
