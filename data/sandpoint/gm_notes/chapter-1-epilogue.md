## When the Heroes Return

They will be immediately noticed by one of the townsfolk who will call out to them, and they will be swarmed by a crowd of people in no time. They'll be bombarded by questions of all kinds. Ameiko and Junior will get special attention, but amongst all that someone will demand to know about the goblins. When told that they've killed the goblins, the crowd will let out a [huge cheer]($load|effect|mixkit-huge-crowd-cheering-victory-462.wav).

While the crowd is celebrating, [Sheriff Hemlock](^sandpoint/sheriff_hemlock.jpg) will arrive to check out what's going on. After that, things will happen quickly:

* Take [Ameiko](^sandpoint/ameiko_kaijitsu_1.png) to [Father Zantus](^sandpoint/father_zantus.jpg) to get healed.
* Deliver the news to [Bethana Corwin](^sandpoint/bethana_corwin.jpeg) that Ameiko is okay.
* Private debriefing and discussion of what to do next between [Sheriff Hemlock](^sandpoint/sheriff_hemlock.jpg) and [Mayor Kendra Deverin](^sandpoint/kendra_deverin.jpg).
  * Hemlock will insist they can't be certain yet the goblins aren't planning a counterattack. Mayor Deverin will agree, but insist they need to lean into the mood of celebration. Because "the people of Sandpoint need a win right now."
* A [celebration](^sandpoint/sandpoint_celebration.jpg) ([ambience]($load|ambience|sandpoint/RPG Ambience - Joyful Festival crowd, music, cheering.mp3)) that night and a speech ([cheers]($load|ambience|Stadium Crowd Noise - Cheering Crowd.ogg)) from Mayor Deverin, extolling the virtues, heroism, and bravery of the Heroes. She will present them with rewards.
  * From [Vorvashali Voon](^sandpoint/vorvashali_voon.jpg), a [Staff of Birdcalls](^sandpoint/staff_of_birdcalls.jpg) ([item](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/Staff of Birdcalls))
  * From [Ilsoari Gandethus](^sandpoint/ilsoari_gandethus.jpg), a [Viol of Illusions](^sandpoint/viol_of_illusions.jpg) ([item](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/Instrument of Illusions))

[Meanwhile in Magnimar...](^sandpoint/meanwhile_in_magnimar.jpg)

_Meanwhile, in [an opulent office](^sandpoint/xaneshas_office.jpg) somewhere in Magnimar, the setting sun is shining through tall windows framed by heavy curtains. The deep red light illuminates a woman in a plush, velvet chair as she sips at a glass of expensive wine. A man enters, neither knocking nor announcing himself. The woman addresses him without looking at him._

**Woman:** You're late.

**Man:** My apologies, my lady. I had to step out on official business. Though your visits are always a welcome distraction.

**Woman:** Always so quick with the excuses and the flattery. You're lucky you're so good at both. What news of our plans?

_The man settles into a chair beside the woman, taking a second wineglass from a side table that has already been filled._

**Man:** Vice Justice Hart's latest report confirms our suspicions. Thistletop has been raided and the aasimar is dead.

**Woman:** Pity. She was an endearing little pet. Too easily given to anger for my tastes, but we all must have our hobbies.

**Man:** This was not a surprise, after what happened to her mentor.

**Woman:** The quasit? You put more faith in that creature than she deserved, darling.

**Man:** Faith is power, my lady. Her faith in the Mother of Monsters was substantial. And Nualia's was even stronger.

**Woman:** And yet it did not save her in the end. *C'est la vie*. At least they did us the favor of cleaning up Alaznist's stain and draining that well of its disgusting power. That little town has been a nasty little incubator for Wrathful souls for too long.

**Man:** Ah yes. A distasteful situation. But onto happier topics: Did you not just send your new pet project on his mission?

**Woman:** Hah! Oh yes, he was already *quite* far gone before I sent him on his errand. I *tingle* with anticipation for his results -- we should be receiving news of further progress within the month. That is, *if* he can accomplish a few simple murders without proper supervision.

_The woman sets down her wineglass, finally turning to look at the man seated beside her._

**Woman:** And what of the Brothers?

**Man:** Business as usual, my lady. We continue to act at your pleasure, and the harvest proceeds apace. I anticipate another three score souls before the month's end.

_The woman cackles with glee, putting her hand on the man's arm._

**Woman:** Wonderful! You never cease to please, pet.

_The man smiles, picking up the woman's hand and raising to his lips to kiss her knuckles reverently._

**Man:** I live for your pleasure, my lady.

_The woman smiles coyly, purring her approval._

**Woman:** And such a pleasure you are.
