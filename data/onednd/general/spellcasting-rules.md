## Arcane Spells

An Arcane Spell draws on the ambient magic of the multiverse. Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards harness this magic, as do Artificers.

The Arcane Spells table is a partial list of Arcane Spells. The table provides a Spell's level, name, and School of Magic. The list also indicates whether a Spell has the Ritual tag.

If a Spell's School of Magic is different from what appears in the 2014 Player's Handbook, an asterisk (*) appears after the school.

## Divine Spells

A Divine Spell draws on the power of gods and the Outer Planes. Clerics and Paladins harness this magic.

The Divine Spells table is a partial list of Divine Spells. The table provides a Spell's level, name, and School of Magic. The list also indicates whether a Spell has the Ritual tag.

If a Spell's School of Magic is different from what appears in the 2014 Player's Handbook, an asterisk (*) appears after the school.
