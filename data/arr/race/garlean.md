*Do you know the most reliable way to deal with those who stubbornly refuse to see reason? You conquer them─crush them under heel. Such was the trusted method of Allag, and one still favored by Garlemald. But conquest is the easy part. The true challenge begins once the dust has settled─quenching the glowing embers of animosity and maintaining a semblance of peace. This requires the conqueror to treat the conquered with dignity, and the conquered to let bygones be bygones. A difficult feat to achieve.*

&mdash; Solus van Galvus, Emperor of the Garlean Empire

The Garleans are a people who suffered greatly before finding the means to fight back. In finding their strengths, they in turn became conquerers in their own right. Garleans value advancement and personal ability, while looking down on those who are happy to wallow in stagnation. It is this dogged dedication which has allowed them to build the strongest empire in all of Hydaelyn.

### Physical Description
The Garleans are a hardy people whose life under imperial rule has provided them with strong bodies and agile minds. Their most striking feature is the pearl-like third eye which sits in the center of their forehead. This special third eye is said to provide Garleans with improved spatial recognition. Unfortunately, Garleans also have a damning disadvantage: an extreme difficulty when manipulating aether. 

That said, there are a very rare few in Garlemald who can bend aether. Only those of the strongest minds and the hardest wills master the aetherial control necessary to accomplish this feat.

### Displaced Conquerers 
Once living in the southern, warm reaches of Ilsabard, the Garleans were forced north over time when they could not stand in the face of magic-wielding oppressors. Eventually they had to cross the treacherous, frigid peaks of Magna Glacies, leading them to settle in lands with long, bitter winters and short growing periods. However, their misfortune would eventually lead to a great boon in the discovery of ceruleum, an aetherized fuel which they used to start a golden age of Imperial technology.

The Garleans and the Garlean Empire have incurred the disdain of many races across the land. Those within the Empire may have a great love for their empire and fellow citizens, but conquered citizens in Garlemald's annexed regions, or indeed the rest of Eorzea, don't feel so charitable. As such, most races who are not Garleans usually automatically start with a Hostile attitude toward the Empire and its citizens.

### Advent of Magitek
Experimentation and innovation in the field of ceruleum-based engineering led to the glorious birth of magitek. Over the years, the Garlean Empire has invented countless machines and devices which could mimic magical effects and thus finally swung the pendulum in the Garleans' favor. Within 50 years of the rise of magitek, they've managed to fight back and expand from the small, frigid snowfield of Garlemald to a vast empire which now spans three-quarters of the Three Great Continents.

### Freedom Through Technology
Garleans may adventure for a variety of reasons, but a Garlean PC must have fled the reaches of their empire. They may seek freedom from the chains of their society, or perhaps they were forced out for treachery against the Emperor Solus zos Galvus. Perhaps they've always admired Eorzea, or want to learn to use magic. Or maybe they're a half-breed, born of a Garlean soldier and an Eorzean civilian, finding acceptance in neither society. Garlemald's rigid hierarchy where social standing can only be achieved with military prowess can be difficult for some, so in the name of freedom and peace a Garlean here or there may break away from their homeland and chase their dreams.

> ##### Optional Racial Trait
>
> **Magically Inert.** You have a great deal of difficulty casting magic on your own power and require the aid of technology to do so.
> 
> On Hydaelyn, the Garleans by and large cannot manipulate aether under their own power. That said, it is not impossible for a Garlean to gain the ability to do so with hard work and dedication. Half-Garleans have no trouble at all thanks to their mixed blood.
>
> When playing a casting class as a Garlean, consider flavoring their casting focus to account for this. For example, a Garlean Wizard might have a contraption which recharges aether over time which the wizard uses to cast his spells.
> 
> That said, just because a Garlean cannot manipulate aether doesn't mean they aren't made of it, just like everything else on this star. Any class that requires you to draw on your inner aether still works for Garleans -- they just may need a little help from their machines to do it.
