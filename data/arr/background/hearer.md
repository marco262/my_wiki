You realized at a young age that you possessed a preternatural awareness and could sense the intent of the elementals - guardian spirits of the Twelveswood. This gift was recognized by conjurers of Stillglade Fane, who nurtured and encouraged it as you grew in hopes that, someday, you would become a leader in Gridanian society.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Nature
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Herbalism Kit

## Connection to Nature
Choose from the table, or roll a d4 to determine the trinket that represents your connection to nature.

| d4  | Trinket                                                |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A pouch of Shroud topsoil.                             |
|  2  | An icon of Nophica, carved from rosewood.              |
|  3  | A collection of both earth and wind-aspected crystals. | 
|  4  | A broom of Matron's Mistletoe.                         |

## Feature: Children of the Matron
Within the Twelveswood, you can both hear the voices and feel the emotions of the elementals, providing insight on their mood and current events in the region. They speak Padjali but as beings comprised of pure aether, the gulf between their perceptions and those of men are disparate - attempts at translation are, at best, an interpretation. For example, an elemental speaking of a broken stream could be referring to a stagnant aether current, contaminated body of water, or something else entirely.

As long as you act in the best interests of Gridania, this gift commands respect from Gridanian authorities and you are able to secure free room and board at Stillglade Fane.

## Suggested Characteristics
Hearers usually identify with the Lawful Good alignment, best suited to placate the mercurial elementals. Outside of the Twelveswood, hearers can find themselves more at ease - the consequences of any selfish actions being far less dire.

|  2  | The grand city-state of Gridania, forever at the mercy of screeching tree-urchins. Beggars belief... |
|  3  | I'm afraid of them. One simple misstep and I'm dead.                                                 |
|  4  | I struggle to "hear" with other people around.                                                       |
|  5  | I wish the elementals, and practically everyone else, would just be quiet.                           |
|  6  | My "gift" is a curse, I didn't choose to have it.                                                    |

## Optional Feature Extension

If you belong to the Padjal race, you can directly communicate with any heard elementals. But they will eventually withdraw from your presence after 1d4 minutes, due to their fickle nature.

At your DM's determination, if an elemental becomes agitated or senses ill intentions from you or a party member during this communion, it may feel threatened and become temperamental. You or your DM can roll a d20 to determine its reaction.

| d20   | Reaction                                                                                 |
|:------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-6   | The elemental casts *Invisibility* and retreats.                                         |
| 7-12  | The weather begins to turn for the worse.                                                |
| 13-16 | The elemental retreats, but harasses the party by casting *Thorn Whip* and *Entangle.*   |
| 17-18 | The elemental retreats, but the party is now being hunted by 1d6 beasts.                 |
| 19    | A herd of 1d10 Medium and Large-sized beasts stampede through the party's location.      |
| 20    | The elemental casts *Awaken,* creating 1d4 **Awakened Trees** & 1d8 **Awakened Shrubs.** |
