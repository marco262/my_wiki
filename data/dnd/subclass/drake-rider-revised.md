[[breadcrumb /dnd/class/Revised Ranger|Revised Ranger]]

Drakes are distant cousins of dragons, but where dragons are proud, solitary, and fiercely intelligent, drakes are social creatures closer in intelligence to a horse or a dog. Drake riders have learned how to tame these beasts, and even how to train them for combat.

You have raised a Drake from hatchling and formed a special bond with it, to the point of being magically connected to them. Your Drake is now large enough to become your steed and well-trained enough to carry you into battle.

*Note: This subclass is meant to be used with the [Revised Ranger](http:*media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/UA_RevisedRanger.pdf).*

## Draconic Mount

[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]
**Nightfury**

The Nightfury is a variant drake type you can choose, with GM approval. The Nightfury has the same stats as the standard Drake Companion, but its Strength is reduced to 15, its fly speed is increased to 60 ft, it gains thunder resistance, and its breath weapon is a concussive blast with a 30 ft. range that does thunder damage in a 10 ft. sphere.
[[/div]]

At 3rd level, your Drake is strong enough to enter combat with you.

The stat block for your Drake is below:

[[div style="display:inline-block; vertical-align: top; "]]
[[include dnd/monster-sheet.tpl]]
width = 350px
name = Drake Companion
size = Large
type = dragon
alignment = neutral
armor_class = 17 (natural armor)
hit_points = 24 (3d8 + 9)
speed = 30 ft., fly 40 ft.
strength = 19
dexterity = 10
constitution = 17
intelligence = 6
wisdom = 12
charisma = 8
saves = Dex +2, Con +5
skills = Athletics +6, Perception +3
senses = passive Perception 13
languages = Draconic
special_abilities = 
actions = !**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
[[/include]]

[[/div]]

Choose a type for your Drake from the Drake Types table below. Your Drake gains resistance to its element type.

### Drake Types

||~ Drake ||~ Damage Type ||~ Breath Weapon ||
|| Black || Acid || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Blue || Lightning || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Brass || Fire || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Bronze || Lightning || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Copper || Acid || 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) ||
|| Gold || Fire || 15 ft. cone (Dex. Save) ||
|| Green || Poison || 15 ft. cone (Con. Save) ||
|| Red || Fire || 15 ft. cone (Dex. Save) ||
|| Silver || Cold || 15 ft. cone (Con. Save) ||
|| White || Cold || 15 ft. cone (Con. Save) ||

Whenever you gain a ranger level, your Drake gains a hit die and its maximum HP increases by 1d8 + its Constitution modifier. At levels 5, 9, 13, and 17, your Drake's saves, skills, and attack bonus increase by 1.

Your Drake acts as a Controlled mount, meaning it acts on your turn and can only take the Dash, Disengage, and Dodge actions, whether you're mounted on it or not.

You and your Drake share an empathic link and can communicate clearly with each other, even if you don't speak the same language. Your Drake is solely devoted to you and will not willingly let anyone but you ride it. It follows your commands without question and will protect you with its life if necessary.

If your Drake is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your Drake's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return a Drake to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.

## Blazing Speed

While mounted on your Drake, you can use the Dash action to move your Drake up to its speed. This can be used alongside the Drake's own Dash action.

## Combat Training

While mounted on your Drake, you can use a bonus action to command the Drake to use its Bite attack on any creature within its reach. Its Bite attack's damage dice increase as you level up as shown in the Bite Damage column of the Drake Rider table.

## Draconic Intuition

At 5th level, you've spent enough time in your Drake's company to gain a certain insight into the workings of the minds of draconic creatures. You have advantage on any Animal Handling, Persuasion, or Insight checks when interacting with drakes or dragons. You also have advantage against a dragon's Frightful Presence ability.

## Drake Fire

At 7th level, while mounted on your Drake, you can use a bonus action to command it to use its breath weapon. Each creature in the breath weapon's area must make a DC 14 saving throw, taking 3d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The type of saving throw and type of damage are determined by your Drake's type, as shown in the Drake Types table.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

Your Drake's breath weapon damage and save DC increase as you level up as shown in the Drake Rider table.

## Hooked Claws

At 11th level, when your Drake hits a creature with its Bite attack, it can attempt to grapple that creature. 

While grappling a creature of Medium size or smaller, your Drake's speed is not halved while moving the grappled creature, even allowing your Drake to fly while carrying the creature.

## Destructive Fury

At 15th level, your Drake is able to use its Drake Fire more often. At the start of each of your turns, if you've already spent your use of Drake Fire, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, you regain your use of Drake Fire.
