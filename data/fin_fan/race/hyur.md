> _Thal's Balls...I'd forgotten what it was like to feel so alive! Not since leaving the Bloodsands have I had the privilege. Not since the Bull of Ala Mhigo hung up his swords. Back then, the outcome might have been different. But I do not begrudge you your victory. I know how far you have come, how much you have endured. Our fight only confirmed it. We shall have to do this again one day, when time allows._

Around 1000 years ago, the Hyur spread across the land in a great migration from the north. They made their homes wherever they could set their footing. Some took to the mountains, while others found a foot hold in any city which would accept them. Today the Hyur are one of the most populous races in the world.

## Of Average Build

The Hyur are a race of average sized humanoids whom one may view as an average group of people, lacking distinguishing features such as pointed ears, immense size or horns. Over time Hyur have diverged into two distinct groups, the Midlanders and Highlanders. Midlanders are widespread across the land and come in all shapes and colours, becoming prevalent in all cities. Highlanders in comparison are taller than their Midlander counterparts, boasting a more powerful, muscular build.

## A Matter of Location

The differences between the Midlanders and Highlanders was born from their homes long ago. The Highlanders are named for living at a high elevation, mountains in particular.

These tough living conditions lead to a heartier, more physically powerful people. The Midlanders lived at sea level and across the world, which minimized changes due to life in extreme conditions.

## People of the World

Hyur as a whole make up a large percentage of the population in the world. Over a thousand years ago the Hyur immigrated in massive waves from their homelands and made their homes wherever their feet hit the ground. Highlanders are a special case within the Hyur, famed for their mountainous city of Ala Mhigo. In recent years, the Ala Mighans were forced from their homes to immigrate across the world, mixing into the cities across the world themselves.

## Glory and Prosperity

The Hyur are a hardworking and ambitious people, no matter what walk of life they come from. It is for this reason that for every Hyur in the world, there could be a different reason to seek adventure. Some may head out on the road for the value of the journey itself, while others may do so in search of riches. Some Hyur may be adventuring on another's behalf, perhaps their family sitting at home, or to defend their people from an imminent threat. In a world with so many possibilities, it does not take much convincing to bring a Hyur to action.

## Hyur Names

The names of the Hyur are in the common tongue of the land. Midlander may take names which are appropriate for the culture in which they live while Highlanders take names which have a harshness in their pronunciation. As a surname, Midlanders will often take a descriptive name for their physical traits or profession. Highlanders prefer to earn their surnames in battle, using feats of martial prowess or names with violent imagery.
