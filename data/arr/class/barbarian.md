A roegadyn woman stands locked in combat with a hobgoblin. She meets each swing of his blade with ferocity and powerful blows. The woman feeds off the ecstasy of battle, receiving succor with each blow she lands.

A miqo'te man dashes into the heat of battle, his earth-shaking battle cry summoning spectral shades from the aether. Bright figures of light stream toward his enemies, adding their cries to his as their opponents are swiftly overwhelmed.

A lightly armored figure stands at his allies' sides. She can feel the draw of the Primal, bubbling just under her skin and threatening to break loose at the idea of a fight. As her fangs lengthen, she smiles.

These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.

For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

### Indomitable Forces
Like a symbol crash in an orchestra, a barbarian is an explosive force which stands out in any situation. Their booming voice, raw strength and powerful strikes are their tools for victory. These fearless fighters are peerless in their control of a force which they call the inner beast. Barbarian bands once roamed unsettled lands as nomads, enjoying the boons which nature offers and defending the weak from those who would do them harm.

### Unending Rage
Not unlike nature itself, a barbarian has the potential to become a relentless force of destruction. Like a raging forest fire, or an all-consuming tidal wave, a barbarian can unleash their inner beast to harness its fury. This state of being is known as Rage. While raging, barbarians continually chase foes and defend allies, using their bloodlust to keep themselves in the battle as a threat.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, barbarians in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Paths
You may select from the following paths:

| Path  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Path of the Ancestral Guardian  | *XGtE* |
|  Path of the Beast  | *TCoE* |
|  Path of the Berserker  | *PHB* |
|  Path of the Totem Warrior  | *PHB* |

##### Path of the Ancestral Guardian
The spirits of this path in Eorzea are not necessarily ancestors, nor even departed. Rather they seem to be echoes of living people in their own right. Scholars have studied the phenomenon, but the average barbarian would know little to nothing about it. All they know is that at times, the vision of unknown persons living will appear to them in aid.

##### Path of the Beast
A barbarian of this path has had some contact with a Primal, and the Primal's influence has lingered and allows him to take on their traits and features.

| d4  | Origin |
|:---|:-----------|
|  1  | Your mother was tempered while pregnant with you, and it's left residual influence in you. |
|  2  | You are descended from the high priest of one of the Primal cults. |
|  3  | An Ascian came to you when you were young and brought you to a summoning. |
|  4  | You were intended to be a mortal sacrifice to a Primal but you managed to escape. |

##### Path of the Berserker
The Berserker is the quintessential barbarian in Eorzea. A berserker is the most powerful and enduring presence on the battlefield, and they often account for the most enemies defeated. Their role in combat is that of a steel whirlwind, dealing death and destruction without equal.

##### Path of the Totem Warrior
Barbarians of the Totem Warrior are those who can sense the dire creep of encroaching darkness. They are typically working in tandem with both the Elementals and animal spirits of the land, striving to bring Eorzea back into balance. 

Eorzean totems are as follows:
| PHB Totem  | Eorzean Totem |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Bear  | Goobbue |
|  Eagle  | Drake |
|  Elk  | Antelope |
|  Tiger  | Coeurl |
|  Wolf  | Jackal |
