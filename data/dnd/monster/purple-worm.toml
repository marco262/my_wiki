***Multiattack.*** The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 3d8 + 9}) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a {@dc 19} Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is {@condition blinded} and {@condition restrained}, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a {@dc 21} Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall {@condition prone} in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer {@condition restrained} by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting {@condition prone}.

***Tail Stinger.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 14} to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. {@h}19 ({@damage 3d6 + 9}) piercing damage, and the target must make a {@dc 19} Constitution saving throw, taking 42 ({@damage 12d6}) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
