**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) piercing damage.

**Eye Ray.** The zombie uses a random magical eye ray, choosing a target that it can see within 60 feet of it.

1. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[[general:conditions#paralyzed|paralyzed]]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
2. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
4. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.<br>If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger non magical object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.
