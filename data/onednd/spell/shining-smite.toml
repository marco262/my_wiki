As you hit the creature, your strike flares with divine light. The target hit by the strike takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage from the attack. If the target has the [[glossary:Invisible]] condition, that condition ends on it. In addition, until the spell ends, the target sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have Advantage, and it can't benefit from the [[glossary:Invisible]] condition.
