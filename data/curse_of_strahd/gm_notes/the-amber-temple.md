# Notes

Before going into the Amber Temple, tell the players the following things:

* This is a dungeon, and I will be running it like one.
* This means monsters, random encounters, traps, secret doors, and the like.
* Just because you've previously explored a room does not mean it's guaranteed to be safe when you return.
* Not every room in the dungeon will have something interesting, but exploration *will* be rewarded (if you look in the right places).
* You do not need to fight everything you come across in this dungeon.
* Getting out alive is not guaranteed, nor are you guaranteed to safely take rests here.
* Your choice of whether to bring a light source will be important. Having a light source means it will be easier to see around you, but it may tip off things in the dungeon that you're approaching.
* Reminder: If you have darkvision, you treat complete darkness as dim light. This means that any Perception check related to sight is made at disadvantage. This means that it's easier for things to sneak up on you in darkness, even if you have darkvision.
* What loot you can carry out will be limited by your carrying capacity (15 x Strength score), so take some time to work out the weight of the items you currently have on hand. If you don't know the weight of any of your items, let me know and I'll tell you.

  * The following inscription has been carved into the frame above the front door into the Amber Temple:<br><blockquote markdown=1>*If you seek honor or power, turn back - for these walls hold naught but doom.*<br>*In amber tombs below, the darkness shelters a timeless evil.*<br>*This temple is infected with a scourge of malevolent divinity.*<br>*Our arrogance and folly forged this place into our prison.*<br>*Leave now, before our damnation becomes yours.*</blockquote>
  * A character with a passive Perception of 15 or greater notices that the snow to the left side of the temple entrance appears to have been traversed recently. A DC 15 Survival check reveals a set of human footprints alongside a much larger pair of canine paw prints leading to Area X1a (Narrow Fissure). A DC 15 Nature check can identify the paw prints as belonging to a winter wolf.
