**Tenets of Vengeance**

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Vengeance vary, Paladins of this oath share these tenets.

***Fight the Greater Evil.*** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

***No Mercy for the Wicked.*** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

***By Any Means Necessary.*** My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

***Restitution.*** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by my misdeeds.

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside -- at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

### 3rd Level: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### 3rd Level: Vow of Enmity

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You gain Advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute.

If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required). You can make this transfer no more than once per turn.

### 7th Level: Relentless Avenger

Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, you can reduce the creature's Speed to 0, and you can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.

### 15th Level: Soul of Vengeance

Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack, you can use your Reaction to make a melee attack against that creature if it's within range.

### 20th Level: Avenging Angel

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the following benefits for 10 minutes or until you end them as a Bonus Action:

**Flight.** You sprout spectral wings on your back. You have a [[glossary:Fly Speed]] equal to your Speed and can Hover.  
**Frightful Aura.** Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have Advantage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of it by expending a 5th-level spell slot (no action required).
