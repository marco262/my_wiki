description: 'Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature''s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the [https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PH-Errata-V1.pdf end] of each of the frightened creature''s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.'
