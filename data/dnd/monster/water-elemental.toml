***Water Form.*** The elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 7} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage.

***Whelm {@recharge 4}.*** Each creature in the elemental's space must make a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. If it is Large or smaller, it is also {@condition grappled} (escape {@dc 14}). Until this grapple ends, the target is {@condition restrained} and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the elemental's space.

The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the elemental's turns, each target {@condition grappled} by it takes 13 ({@damage 2d8 + 4}) bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a {@dc 14} Strength check and succeeding.
