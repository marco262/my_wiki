Churning magical energy explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. When you cast the spell, you select he type of damage dealt by the explosion: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 damage of the chosen type. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

Choose one of those d6s. The number rolled on that die determines a condition that's applied to each creature that failed the save, as shown below. A creature has the condition until the end of your next turn.

| d6 | Additional Effect          |

| 1  | [[glossary:Incapacitated]] |
| 2  | Blinded                    |
