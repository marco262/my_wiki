description: "A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration.\n\nThe wind has the following effects:\n\n* It deafens you and other creatures in its area.\n* It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.\n* The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.\n* The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if they pass in or out of the wind.\n* It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind."
