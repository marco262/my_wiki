The Teppichverkäufer Family are a group of gnomes who have lived in Trollskull Alley for the past 70 years. They moved in when Ulkoria Stonemarrow owned Trollskull Manor, and have seen it deteriorate since then.

They are a family of carpet merchants who have a near monopoly on the buying and reselling of carpets, via having contacts in the Most Excellent Order of Weavers and Dyers that allow them to do so.

When the adventurers moved in next door, they were lukewarm at best. On the one hand, maybe the adventurers could take care of the ghost that had been keeping them up at night. On the other hand, adventurers are not know for improving property value, and Trollskull Alley had been degentrifying at an alarming rate over the last several years. 

The party's improvements to the Manor, as well as their devotion to making the neighborhood safer, had begun to win the Teppichverkäufers over. But when they took the family in after their house was partially destroyed, the Teppichverkäufers are now 100% enamored with the party. Though they may still have comments to make about their house or way of living.
