***Resolution.*** If the character rolls no successes, he must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine. 

***Complications.*** A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check. If the character's rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks.
