While you're traveling and exploring, tell the GM what you'd generally like to do along the way. It isn't necessary to go into detail, such as "Using my dagger, I nudge the door, so I can check for devious traps." Instead, "I'm searching the area for hazards" is sufficient. The GM finds the best exploration activity to match your description and describes the effects of that activity.

You can only use exploration activities while your party is moving no faster than a [Normal Pace](/dnd/general/Adventuring#travel-pace).

Below are the most common exploration activities, but additional options may be available depending on the situation, like deciphering a secret message written on a wall, trying to piece together a puzzle, or navigating a set of dangerous runes inscribed on the floor.

## Cover Tracks

You take care to cover the party's tracks as you explore. Anyone tracking you must succeed at a Survival check against your passive Survival DC.

## Defend

You move cautiously, ready to defend from attacks. If combat breaks out, you gain the benefits of the Dodge action until the start of your first turn. If you are Surprised on your first turn in combat, you can continue Defending until the start of your next turn.

## Follow the Expert

Choose an ally attempting a recurring skill check while exploring, such as climbing, or performing a different exploration tactic that requires a skill check (like Sneaking). The ally must be at least an expert in that skill and must be willing to provide assistance. While Following the Expert, you match their tactic and attempt similar skill checks. Thanks to your ally's assistance, you can roll those checks with Proficiency if the ally has Proficiency in that check, or with Expertise if your ally has Expertise.

## Hustle

You strain yourself to move at double your travel speed. You can Hustle only for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— 10 (minimum 10 minutes). If you are in a group that is Hustling, use the lowest Constitution modifier among everyone to determine how fast the group can Hustle together. 

This is different from traveling at a [Fast Pace](/dnd/general/Adventuring#travel-pace), which you can do indefinitely.

## Repeat a Spell

You repeatedly cast the same spell while exploring. Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in a single turn. In order to prevent fatigue due to repeated casting, you'll likely use this activity only when something out of the ordinary occurs.

You can also cast ritual spells, like _[[[spell:Detect Magic]]]_, though you must concentrate on the spell the entire time you are using this activity.

## Rest

You take it slow, focusing on letting yourself recuperate from your adventures. After an uninterrupted hour of using the Rest activity, you can gain the benefit of a Short Rest. You can take multiple Short Rests in a row with this activity, if you like.

## Scout

You scout ahead and behind the group to watch for danger. You get advantage on Perception checks to detect any hidden creatures or ambushes. The DM will adjust your passive Perception score to account for this.

## Search

You search meticulously for hidden doors, concealed hazards, and so on. You can usually make an educated guess as to which locations are best to check. If you come across a secret door, item, or hazard while Searching, the GM will use your passive Investigation score to see if you notice the hidden object or hazard. 

## Sneak

You move stealthily to attempt to avoid notice. This might enable you to sneak up on an enemy without them noticing you. If you're Sneaking at the start of an encounter, there's a chance the enemy will be Surprised.

If the entire party is moving at a [Slow Pace](/dnd/general/Adventuring#travel-pace), you make any Stealth checks as part of your Sneaking activity with advantage.
