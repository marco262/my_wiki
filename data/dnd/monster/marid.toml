***Water Jet.*** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 16} Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 ({@damage 6d6}) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked {@condition prone}. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked {@condition prone}.
