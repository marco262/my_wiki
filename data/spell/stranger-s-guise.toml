description = """You wrap yourself in an illusion that makes you appear to be a stranger to all who see you. You either appear as your own race, or as one of the races commonly found in the area you're in (your choice), though the race must be the same size and have the same basic body shape as you.

Each person that sees you sees a unique visage that is unfamiliar to them. You have no control over that visage's physical traits, including hair color, skin color, eye color, clothes, weight, height (within 1 foot taller or shorter), voice, accent, and various body odors. If you cast this spell again later, anyone who's seen you before may see the same visage they saw before, or they may see a new one. However, no two people will see the same visage.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC."""
