## Commoner

You come from a humble social rank, but you are casting off your old life to rise up as an adventurer: a much riskier, but much more rewarding, profession. A part of you is certain that you are destined for so much more than the life you left. There are monsters and bandits and Twelve know what out there, threatening good rustic folk like those you grew up around. *Someone's* gotta take care of 'em.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools, vehicles (land)
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

### Defining Event:
You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things.

| d8 | Defining Event |
|:----:|:-----------|
|  1  | I stood up to the Serpent Reavers, the nastiest pirating crew this side of the Rhotano. |
|  2  | I foresaw the damage wrought by the Calamity and managed to shield my community from harm. |
|  3  | I was the only one to successfully spend the night in the haunted lighthouse, Pharos Sirius. |
|  4  | I defeated a monster through sheer luck, and the stories told about me get wilder and more convoluted with each telling. It's gone on too long to correct them now. |
|  5  | I joined the Upright Thieves to protect the commonfolk against the pilferin' of no-good pirates. |
|  6  | People keep confusing me for a real local hero who hasn't been seen in ages. I can't seem to convince them otherwise, no matter how hard I try. |
|  7  | I was the only one unaffected by a recent plague and was able to get help for those stricken. |
|  8  | I was captured by Sahagin as a sacrificial thrall to their Primal, but I helped my fellow prisoners escape. |

### Feature: Rustic Hospitality
Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

### Suggested Characteristics
You are one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most commonfolk adventurers look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.
