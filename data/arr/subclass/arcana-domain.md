[[breadcrumb /arr/class/Cleric|Cleric]]

A Cleric who serves the domain of Arcana is an expert in Aether. Under the guidance of the gods, they have learned to tap not only divine power, but that of arcanum too. They are experts at guiding their allies with both powers at hand.

The gods of this domain have their hands deep in the aetherflows of the universe. Althyk the Keeper surveys change, space, and time. Nymeia is the goddess of fate. Both command the flow of mortal fate through the hands of arcana.

## Arcane Initiate

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the [wizard spell list](/dnd/class_spell_list/wizard/true). For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

## Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures. As an action, you present your holy symbol and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice with 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided it can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as the *[[[spell:banishment]]]* spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the table below.

||~ Cleric Level ||~ Banishes Creatures of CR ... ||
||5th||1/2||
||8th||1||
||11th||2||
||14th||3||
||17th||4||

## Spell Breaker

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

_8th-level cleric feature, which replaces the Divine Strike or Potent Spellcasting feature_

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

## Arcane Mastery

At 17th level, you chose four spells from the [wizard spell list](/dnd/class_spell_list/wizard/true), one for each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.
