description = """
This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: _[[[spell:cure wounds]]]_ (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), _[[[spell:lesser restoration]]]_ (2 charges), or _[[[spell:mass cure wounds]]]_ (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
