***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one with its glaive.

***Beard.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. {@h}6 ({@damage 1d8 + 2}) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Glaive.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 5} to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 1d10 + 3}) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or lose 5 ({@dice 1d10}) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 ({@dice 1d10}). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful {@dc 12} Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
