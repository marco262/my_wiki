description: "You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell -- and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter -- you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

at_higher_levels_text: 'When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.'
