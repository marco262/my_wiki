description = """
This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of [[[general:Equipment#tools|artisan's tool]]] of your choice. Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding this tool, you gain a bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells. The bonus is determined by the tool's rarity.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
