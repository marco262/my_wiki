## Story

When Rek arrives at the warehouse, Quizno will be having a meeting with a duergar gang inside the warehouse, with his goblin henchmen hanging around and acting all menacing. It's an unfriendly meeting, as the duergar are angry that Quizno hasn't delivered his [insert item here]. Hands are on weapons, and it's not looking good.

The goblins are on edge, the duergar guards are on edge, the duergar boss is unhappy... and Quizno is calm. He manages to convince the duergar that they'll have their stuff for them that night. The duergar are barely appeased and head off. The goblin thugs ask Quizno how they're gonna deliver when they don't actually have the stuff, and Quizno says they'll just ambush the duergar that night.

The meeting that night will happen in the street in front of the warehouse, with weapons bristling and tensions high. Extra goblin thugs will be waiting hidden behind crates and in windows to ambush the duergar.
