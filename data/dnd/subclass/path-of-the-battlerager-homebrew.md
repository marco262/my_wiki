Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.

## Battlerager Armor

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you gain a set of [[[equipment:Armor and Shields#spiked-armor|spiked armor]]] as a weapon. If you use Unarmored Defense while wearing the armor your AC increases by 1, otherwise it counts as Medium Armor with an AC of 14 + your Constitution modifier.

While you are wearing spiked armor and raging, and either wielding a shield, a single weapon, or no weapons, you can use a bonus action to make one unarmed strike empowered by your armor at a target within 5 feet of you. While wearing the armor your unarmed strikes count as weapon attacks, and deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier in piercing damage.

Additionally, while in your armor when you successfully grapple a creature, or a creature grapples you, the creature takes piercing damage equal to your proficiency bonus.

## Reckless Abandon

Beginning at 6th level, when you use Reckless Attack while raging, you also gain temporary hit points equal to half your Barbarian level (minimum of 1). They vanish if any of them are left when your rage ends.

## Battlerager Charge

Beginning at 10th level, you can take the Dash action as abonus action while you are raging. If you Dash at least 20ft in a straight line towards a creature and make a melee weapon attack or attempt a grapple, the attack or grapple has Advantage and you deal bonus damage to the creature equal to double your proficiency bonus.

## Close Quarters Brawler

At 14th level, no one wants to take you on in a fight, tavern brawl or otherwise. If you are raging and take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike against the creature. If the unarmed strike hits and you have an open hand, you can choose to automatically grapple the creature.
