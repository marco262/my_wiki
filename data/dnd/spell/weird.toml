description = """Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]] for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end[[1]](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PH-Errata-V1.pdf) of each of the [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]] creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature."""
