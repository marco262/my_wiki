This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: _[antipathy/sympathy](/dnd/spell/antipathy/sympathy)_, _[charm person](/dnd/spell/charm person)_, _[dominate person](/dnd/spell/dominate person)_, _[enthrall](/dnd/spell/enthrall)_, _[hypnotic pattern](/dnd/spell/hypnotic pattern)_, _[modify memory](/dnd/spell/modify memory)_, and _[suggestion](/dnd/spell/suggestion)_. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.
* When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
