***Multiattack.*** The solar makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 15} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d6 + 8}) slashing damage plus 27 ({@damage 6d8}) radiant damage.

***Flying Sword.*** The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. If the solar can see the sword, the solar can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to the solar's hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls if the solar dies.
