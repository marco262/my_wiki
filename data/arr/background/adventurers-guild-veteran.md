## Adventurers' Guild Veteran
You are a mainstay at the local adventurers' guild. Sure, you haven't made your name yet, but you've killed some ship rats and rescued some wolf pups. You even picked up an old elezen lady's shopping! Maybe you're still small-time, but you're a step ahead of the greenhorns and you've got an idea of how the system works. And anyway, who says doing things for the little guy is a bad thing? Their smile when you returned their missing coeurl kitten was worth all the gil in the world.

### The Drowning Wench
Your local adventurer's guild proprietor is **Baderon Tenfingers** at the Drowning Wench, a midlander man of forty-eight winters. A skilled mercenary in his youth, he has since retired and opened a tavern in Limsa Lominsa's Upper Decks. He acts as something of a teacher, always looking to help the younger generation find its feet.

He knows you, if not by reputation then at least by sight. You're in his good graces...or not his bad ones.

### Feature: Guild Kickbacks
As long as you remain a member of the guild and maintain a friendly relationship with your local proprietor, you may enjoy complimentary meals and board at no charge to you or your party members. Additionally, your status as a veteran affords you a small following of local fans and admirers.

This feature extends to the other locations by establishing a friendly relationship with their respective proprietors.

### Suggested Characteristics
Adventurers come from a myriad of backgrounds, and with them, their own dreams and motivations. Anyone, whether they be a helpful commoner or a seasoned fighter, can become an adventurer if they have the drive to take on the world.

> ##### The Adventurers' Guild
> The Adventurers' Guild is a supranational organization employing able-bodied people from all walks of life, acting as an intermediary by receiving varied requests for aid from townsfolk. Quests are listed on the adventuring board with accompanying "quest plates" which are then stamped when completed. Adventurers throughout the realm can be found working not just as hired swords, but as tradesmen and gatherers as well.
