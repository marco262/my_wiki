description = "<p>This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a Potion of Healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An <em>_[[[spell:identify]]]_</em> spell reveals its true nature.</p><p>If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[[general:conditions#poisoned|poisoned]]]. At the start of each of your turns while you are [[[general:conditions#poisoned|poisoned]]] in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.</p>"
