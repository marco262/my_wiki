Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elezen summons the power of the stars and summons bright, shooting stars from the heavens to smite the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.

Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a coeurl, a lalafell peers out of the jungle at the strange convocation of beastmen, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.

A quiet and well-groomed hyur waves his cane around himself, summoning his carbuncle to his side. Working together, the two of them kneel to heal the land of creeping rot.

Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will. The druid's goal in life is to safeguard the future by wielding the inherent magic hidden within the land. 

### Power of Nature
A druid's strength stems from an art they refer to as conjury. Conjury calls upon the elements and concentrates them to a potency through which spells can be weaved. Through practiced meditation on the essences of creation, conjurers draw forth and absorb magic from their immediate surroundings. Versed also in magicks that restore and strengthen, druids are also regarded as accomplished healers.

### One With the Light
Druids find their roots in a society which once revered nature as an ally, borrowing the power of the land and Elementals to soothe wounds and protect from the wicked. However, the druids of the past abused this power, causing the<br>Elementals to lash out and clear the land with the<br>Great Flood. Alongside the damage wrought by the wizards of Mhach in the War of the Magi, Hydaelyn fell into a dark age. Today, druids are few and far between, practicing the forbidden art of White Magic to wield the powers of nature and light to drive off evil in protection of the world once more.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, Druids in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Druid Circles
You may select from the following Druid Circles:

| Circle  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Circle of the Land  | *PHB* |
|  Circle of the Moon  | *PHB* |
|  Circle of the Shepherd  | *XGtE* |
|  Circle of Stars  | *TCoE* |

### Druid Circle Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Circles to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn.

#### Circle of the Land
Druids who follow this Circle have been initiated into the secret, long-standing order of druids who once stood against the Black Mages of Mhach in the Sixth Umbral Era during the War of the Magi. Few are left, but the secrets of white magic live on in you and yours.

#### Circle of the Moon
Druids in this Circle are incredibly few and far between. Those who can take on the body of a beast are only legend in Eorzea, yet druids of the moon are not only in possession of this power, but masters of it. Are they such champions of Hydaelyn that they bear the very essence of the star in their aether? Or has something otherworldly and uncanny touched their essence and changed them for good?

#### Circle of the Shepherd
Shepherds are also colloquially called summoners in Eorzea. These druids are often deeply academic, using their knowledge of mathematics and arcanum to summon forth spiritual allies to aid them. The most typical summons are the Carbuncle, aetherial beings summoned forth and given form from a gemstone.

For their 2nd level ability **Spirit Totem**, the following changes are made, for flavor:
| Spirit Totem  | Eorzean Equivalent |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Bear  | Topaz Carbuncle |
|  Hawk  | Ruby Carbuncle |
|  Unicorn  | Emerald Carbuncle |

#### Circle of Stars
You live and breathe the night sky up above. Many druids of this Circle are astromancers, scholars who study the stars and constellations and their influence on life in Eorzea. While astromancy has a somewhat dubious reputation among much of the land, there are pockets of society here and there that revere them and consider them truthtellers.
