The Yellowjackets serve as peacekeepers around Limsa Lominsa and the surrounding settlements. Though they were initially part of the Knights of the Barracuda, following the Calamity, they went independent and were assigned a new position as part of the Maelstrom. 

Like other members of the Maelstrom, they are tasked with keeping peace within Limsa Lominsa, as well as patrolling and stopping acts of piracy. Outside of the city, they patrol and ward off the various monsters that may approach the smaller villages and settlements. They also handle pirates that come near Limsa, or would break part of The Code. 

You have served the Yellowjackets, standing as Vylbrand's first line of defense against crime. You both direct your gaze outward at possible encroaching enemies and help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.

You might have been part of the force in Limsa Lominsa itself, protecting the common folk from honorless thieves and code-breaking rabble. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders around Western La Noscea, guarding against incursions of Sahagin invaders. You might even be one of the force patroling outside Pharos Sirius, a lighthouse that was struck down and destroyed in the Calamity but which now runs amok with voidsent and a dangeorus siren.

Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of Yellowjacket law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.

### Feature: Watcher's Eye

Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals -- especially pirates. You can easily find the local outpost of Yellowjackets or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the [[[background:soldier]]] background as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity.

Your bond is likely associated with your fellow Yellowjacket members or the organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes and thwarting pirates who spit on the Code.

### Variant City Watch: Investigator Extraordinaire

Rarer than Yellowjackets or patrol members are a community's investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in rural areas, nearly every settlement of decent size has at least one or two watch members who have the skill to investigate crime scenes and track down criminals. If your prior experience is as an investigator, you have proficiency in **Investigation** rather than Athletics.
