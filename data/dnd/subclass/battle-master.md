Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, com bat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

## Combat Superiority

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**Maneuvers.** You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under "Maneuvers" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**Superiority Dice.** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**Saving Throws.** Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

* **Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

## Student of War

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

## Know Your Enemy

Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

* Strength score
* Dexterity score
* Constitution score
* Armor Class
* Current hit points
* Total class levels (if any)
* Fighter class levels (if any)

## Improved Combat Superiority

At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

## Relentless

Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die. 

## Maneuvers

The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.

**Ambush.**[((bibcite tashas))] When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.

**Bait and Switch.**[((bibcite tashas))] When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and isn't incapacitated. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

Roll the superiority die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.

**Brace.**[((bibcite tashas))] When a creature you can see moves into the reach you have with the melee weapon you're wielding, you can use your reaction to expend one superiority die and make one attack against the creature, using that weapon. If the attack hits, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.

**Commander's Strike.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Commanding Presence.**[((bibcite tashas))] When you make a Charisma (Intimidation), a Charisma (Performance), or a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Disarming Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

**Distracting Strike.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

**Evasive Footwork.** When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

**Feinting Attack.** You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature this turn.[((bibcite errata))] If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Goading Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

**Grappling Strike.**[((bibcite tashas))] Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and then try to grapple the target as a bonus action. Add the superiority die to your Strength (Athletics) check.

**Lunging Attack.** When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Maneuvering Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

**Menacing Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]] of you until the end of your next turn.

**Parry.** When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

**Pinning Attack.**[((bibcite homebrew))] When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to pin the target, immobilizing it for a moment. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

**Precision Attack.** When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

**Pushing Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

**Quick Toss.**[((bibcite tashas))] As a bonus action, you can expend one superiority die and make a ranged attack with a weapon that has the thrown property. You can draw the weapon as part of making this attack. If you hit, add the superiority die to the weapon's damage roll.

**Rally.** On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

**Riposte.** When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

**Sweeping Attack.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

**Tactical Assessment.**[((bibcite tashas))] When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), an Intelligence (History), or a Wisdom (Insight) check, you can expend one superiority die and add the superiority die to the ability check.

**Trip Attack.** When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target [[[general:conditions#prone|prone]]].

# Battle Master Builds

The Battle Master showcases just how versatile a fighter can be. The suite of maneuvers you choose, when combined with a fighting style and feats, allows you to create a broad range of fighters, each with its own flavor and play style.

Below are recommendations for how you might build a Battle Master to reflect various types of warriors. Each of these builds contains suggested fighting styles, maneuvers, and feats.

## Archer

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#archery|Archery]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Disarming Strike, Distracting Strike, Precision Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#sharpshooter|Sharpshooter]]]

You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar, trusting in a well-placed arrow, javelin, or sling bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that "those who live by the sword die by the bow."

## Bodyguard

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#interception|Interception]]], [[[class:fighter#protection|Protection]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Bait and Switch, Disarming Attack, Goading Attack, Grappling Strike  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#alert|Alert]]], [[[advancement:feats#observant|Observant]]], [[[advancement:feats#sentinel|Sentinel]]], [[[advancement:feats#tough|Tough]]]

Love, money, or some other obligation motivates you to place your own body between harm and the one you're sworn to protect. You have honed the ability to sniff out potential threats and see your charge through dangerous situations.

## Brawler

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#blind-fighting|Blind Fighting]]], [[[class:fighter#two-weapon-fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]], [[[class:fighter#unarmed-fighting|Unarmed Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Ambush, Disarming Attack, Feinting Attack, Pushing Attack, Trip Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#athlete|Athlete]]], [[[advancement:feats#durable|Durable]]], [[[advancement:feats#grappler|Grappler]]], [[[advancement:feats#resilient|Resilient]]], [[[advancement:feats#shield-master|Shield Master]]], [[[advancement:feats#tavern-brawler|Tavern Brawler]]], [[[advancement:feats#tough|Tough]]]

When bottles start breaking and chairs start flying, you're in your element. You love a good scrap, and you've likely seen your share of them. You may or may not have formal training, and while others might call you a dirty fighter, you're still alive.

## Duelist

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#dueling|Dueling]]], [[[class:fighter#two-weapon-fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Evasive Footwork, Feinting Attack, Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack, Riposte  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#defensive-duelist|Defensive Duelist]]], [[[advancement:feats#dual-wielder|Dual Wielder]]], [[[advancement:feats#observant|Observant]]], [[[advancement:feats#savage-attacker|Savage Attacker]]], [[[advancement:feats#weapon-master|Weapon Master]]]

You regard the duel as a proud tradition, a test of skill and wits that brings honor to those who can defeat an enemy while respecting the art. Your search for improvement is a consuming passion, and you draw on the expertise of the masters who've come before you as you work to perfect your form.

## Gladiator

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#defense|Defense]]], [[[class:fighter#two-weapon-fighting|Two-Weapon Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Goading Attack, Menacing Attack, Sweeping Attack, Trip Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#athlete|Athlete]]], [[[advancement:feats#charger|Charger]]], [[[advancement:feats#dual-wielder|Dual Wielder]]], [[[advancement:feats#durable|Durable]]], [[[advancement:feats#grappler|Grappler]]], [[[advancement:feats#savage-attacker|Savage Attacker]]], [[[advancement:feats#tough|Tough]]], [[[advancement:feats#weapon-master|Weapon Master]]]

You've fought to entertain crowds, whether for sport or as punishment. Along the way, you learned to use all manner of weapons to battle all kinds of adversaries. You're practical yet theatrical, and you know how to employ fear as an effective tool in a fight.

## Hoplite

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#defense|Defense]]], [[[class:fighter#thrown-weapon-fighting|Thrown Weapon Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Brace, Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#athlete|Athlete]]], [[[advancement:feats#grappler|Grappler]]], [[[advancement:feats#polearm-master|Polearm Master]]], [[[advancement:feats#sentinel|Sentinel]]], [[[advancement:feats#shield-master|Shield Master]]]

With spear and shield, you follow in the footsteps of the heroes of ages past. You rely on discipline and athleticism to overcome improbable odds. Whether fighting in ranks alongside your comrades or squaring off as a lone warrior, you're equal to the task.

## Lancer

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#dueling|Dueling]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Precision Attack, Pushing Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#heavy-armor-master|Heavy Armor Master]]], [[[advancement:feats#mounted-combatant|Mounted Combatant]]], [[[advancement:feats#savage-attacker|Savage Attacker]]]

When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You ride out to greet your enemy with the point of your weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and only the heaviest blows can deter you.

## Outrider

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#archery|Archery]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Ambush, Distracting Strike, Goading Attack, Precision Attack, Quick Toss  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#alert|Alert]]], [[[advancement:feats#crossbow-expert|Crossbow Expert]]], [[[advancement:feats#mounted-combatant|Mounted Combatant]]], [[[advancement:feats#observant|Observant]]], [[[advancement:feats#sharpshooter|Sharpshooter]]]

You find freedom in the saddle and a companion in your mount. A headlong charge into combat is a blunt instrument for oafs. You prefer mobility and range, opting to find advantageous positions that allow you to deal with foes at full gallop while evading the most dangerous threats.

## Pugilist

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#unarmed-fighting|Unarmed Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork, Grappling Strike, Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Riposte, Trip Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#athlete|Athlete]]], [[[advancement:feats#durable|Durable]]], [[[advancement:feats#grappler|Grappler]]], [[[advancement:feats#savage-attacker|Savage Attacker]]], [[[advancement:feats#tavern-brawler|Tavern Brawler]]]

Where others rely on steel, you've got your fists. Whether through training or experience, you've developed a superior technique that can help you overcome an enemy in an up-close fight.

## Shock Trooper

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#great-weapon-fighting|Great Weapon Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Sweeping Attack  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#charger|Charger]]], [[[advancement:feats#great-weapon-master|Great Weapon Master]]], [[[advancement:feats#heavy-armor-master|Heavy Armor Master]]]

Subtlety is not your style. You're trained to get straight into the fighting, busting through enemy lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly. Those who ignore you in combat do so at their peril.

## Skirmisher

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#archery|Archery]]], [[[class:fighter#thrown-weapon-fighting|Thrown Weapon Fighting]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Ambush, Bait and Switch, Distracting Strike, Quick Toss  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#alert|Alert]]], [[[advancement:feats#dual-wielder|Dual Wielder]]], [[[advancement:feats#mobile|Mobile]]], [[[advancement:feats#skulker|Skulker]]]

You thrive amid the chaos of battle. You use your mobility and versatility in combat to soften your adversaries and disrupt their formations. An enemy's plan rarely survives contact with you.

## Strategist

**Fighting Style:** [[[class:fighter#defense|Defense]]]  
**Maneuvers:** Commander's Strike, Commanding Presence, Maneuvering Attack, Rally, Tactical Assessment  
**Feats:** [[[advancement:feats#inspiring-leader|Inspiring Leader]]], [[[advancement:feats#keen-mind|Keen Mind]]], [[[advancement:feats#linguist|Linguist]]]

To you, battles unfold like a game of chess. You understand that strength and speed are important in a fight, but it takes intellect and experience to know how best to apply them. That's where you come in.
