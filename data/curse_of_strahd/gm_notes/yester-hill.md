## Altered Descriptions

Shortly after the ritualist enters the spiritual realm, any creature in the physical world notices the following:

> Spiraling wisps of thick, black smoke billow up from the black cairns that ring the hill's multiple terraces, rising up toward the thunderclouds that hang above the hilltop. The clouds grow in size and darkness, thunder rumbling with distant malice. The air crackles with ozone and apprehension -- and then a cacophonous symphony of lightning bolts strikes the ring of boulders around you.
>
> When the bolts' white glare fades from your vision, a sea of roiling black mist has covered the hilltop around you. Its mass bubbles and shifts with the silhouettes of warriors bearing spears, axes, and bows, their eyes red with ill will.
> 
> Before them all stands the smoky silhouette of Kavan, but his demeanor has changed. The tall, broad-shouldered man's spirit is wreathed in the same black smoke that's rising from the black cairns. A pair of blood-red handprints shimmer across his chest, and he carries a long spear that drips with black smoke. His gaze on you is not friendly, but rather is full of malice.
> 
> "I remember everything now," he rumbles, "Most of all, I remember the curse that was placed upon this place, and upon all the warriors buried here, including myself. It demands our defiance against any who would challenge the Shadowsworn's dominance of this place." He levels his spear at you, and growls threateningly. "Cease your mission and go in peace -- or your friend will perish."

## After the Ritual

 * [Anastrasya Karelova](^curse_of_strahd/Anastrasya.jpg) ([stats](Anastrasya Karelova)) shows up, riding [Bucephalus](^curse_of_strahd/bucephalus.jpg) ([stats](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#nightmare_mm))
 * Anastrasya is spitting mad, and berates the party for daring to inconvenience the Master in such a way.
 * She's contemptuous of Ireena, calling her a "passing fancy" and a "fragile toy" that the Master will soon tire of.
 * If Anastrasya is attacked, she defends herself adroitly, while also calling on Bucephalus to whisk her away into the Ethereal Realm.
