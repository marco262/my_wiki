For example, wrathful sinspawn can smell a barbarian who is raging, or just a creature who is predisposed to anger.

These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes [poisoned](/dnd/general/conditions#poisoned) for 1 minute. An affected target that is bitten a second time is [dazed](/dnd/general/conditions#dazed) for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. [Calm emotions](/dnd/spell/Calm Emotions), [remove curse](/dnd/spell/Remove Curse), or [greater restoration](/dnd/spell/Greater Restoration) removes this effect."
