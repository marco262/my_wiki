description = "<p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound.  You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p><p>Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p><p>A creature, including the one [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]], can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.</p><p>Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>"
