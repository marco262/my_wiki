description = """A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]], [[[general:conditions#frightened|frightened]]], paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs."""
