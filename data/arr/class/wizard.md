With a hefty earmarked tome in hand, an elezen closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

A quiet miqo'te woman carefully scratches notes into her research tome. After a long times passes, she wipes the sweat from her brow as a shining avian figure bursts forth from another plane, ready to heed her every command.

Crouching on the floor in the beastmen's lair, a lalafell tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.

Wizards, largely referred to as Mages or sometimes Arcanists, are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the flow of aether that permeates the cosmos, as well as the mathematical weave of the universe, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or powers incredible machines. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

### Magic Through Research
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of aether draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Only through deep understanding of formulas and geometrical figures can they produce magical effects. Their tomes and grimoires are filled with fascinating formulas and diagrams which burst forth into powerful spells when fed aether from their own body. Ever thirsty for greater power, a wizard seeks knowledge and then puts it to the test.

Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures that are steeped in magic.

### The Lure of Knowledge
Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient Allag or Mach or Amdapor knew secrets of aether that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, wizards in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Necromancy
Although there are dark and forbidden arts that are used to raise the undead, they are not used by any right-thinking, civilized people. For, in truth, when you raise the undead, you do not raise a semi-living corpse. Instead, you summon a voidsent — a demon — from the Void, and allow it to inhabit the corpse on this plane. 

The School of Necromancy is not available to PCs.

#### Schools of Magic
You may select from the following Schools of Magic:

| School  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Abjuration  | *PHB* |
|  Bladesinging  | *TCoE* |
|  Conjuration  | *PHB* |
|  Divination  | *PHB* |
|  Enchantment  | *PHB* |
|  Evocation  | *PHB* |
|  Illusion  | *PHB* |
|  Invention  | *UA* |
|  Order of Scribes  | *TCoE* |
|  Transmutation  | *PHB* |


### School Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Schools to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn. Any Schools that are in the chart above but not listed below are essentially unchanged in their theming.

#### School of the Bladesinger
Originally founded in the 6th Umbral Era by the survivors of the War of the Magi, Red Mages are a secretive group who blend white magic, black magic, and the art of the weapon with an intricate and showy performance. Of the various disciplines that make up the red mage school of magic, bladesingers are the most devoted to mastery of magic instead of martial or dextrous mastery. 

#### Order of Scribes
Wizards hailing from Sharlayan, the scholarchy city-state to the northwest, by and large favor the Order of Scribes, which elevates their spellbook to a new level. Why bother writing your thesis when you can magically awaken your book and work on it together? 

#### School of Invention
Wizards of this school are on the bleeding edge of aetherology and magitek engineering. While both are important fields of study on their own, these mages believe that magic can only truly be furthered by the extensive (and sometimes explosive) marriage of both. Many Eorzeans disdain this approach, as magitek has been innately tainted by its invention by the Garlean Empire.

Though most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study and rigorous practice, these wizards would rather throw spells together, add some engineering magic, and see what happens.

For their 2nd level ability **Arcanomechanical Armor**, the following changes are made:

##### **Magitek Armor**

Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of arcane magitek armor.

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to create a suit of magitek armor. To do so, you must modify a suit of light armor over the course of a short rest. In addition to the normal AC modification provided by this armor, as well as any magical properties it might have, it grants you resistance to force damage while you are wearing it. You do not need light armor proficiency to wear this armor.

When you first gain access to this feature, you gain a suit of magitek armor made out of studded leather armor. Whenever you create a new suit of magitek armor, the old suit loses this feature and reverts back to its normal form.

<br>For their 2nd level ability **Reckless Casting**, the following changes are made:

##### Reckless Casting
Any spell cast via Reckless Casting that normally requires concentration no longer does, and lasts its full duration, similar to a Sorcerer's Wild Magic surge.

If a player casts a touch spell via Reckless Casting but there are no valid targets in range, they can use their movement to move towards a target and then apply the spell.
