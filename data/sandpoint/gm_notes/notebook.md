* What does Nualia know about Malfeshnekor, and what are her plans for it?
  * She has talked with Malfeshnekor only in her dreams, and has told him that her god has given her the task to break the binding and take him under her control.
  * Malfeshnekor is just happy someone is working to free him from his binding.
  * She's trying to work out how to perform the ritual shown to her by Lamashtu to remove the binding spell that's keeping Malfeshnekor trapped in that room. [link](https://paizo.com/threads/rzs2t67q?Is-Nualia-dumb#2)
* Shalelu will sneak into Thistletop while party is on their way out, and reassure them the other goblins cleared out

### Player Plans

* Finish exploring Thistletop

* Bring Orik to Sandpoint

### Pre-session checklist

  * Skill checks, saves, and attack rolls
  * Damage and critical hits
  * Action, bonus action, movement, reactions
* Important houserule
  * Adventurer's Intuition (insight checks for hints)
  * Potion of Healing rules
  * Spell changing on long rests
* Have everyone go over their abilities!
* Ask for party leader!
* Recap

### Todo

* Add Current Day box to Calendar
* Come up with list of people who left Sandpoint (two inns at least)
  * Some of them should return to Sandpoint over Downtime
* Have players connect with Roland before he leaves. Maybe he can be murdered in Chapter 2?

### Reminders

* When a player is exploring a space, put them on a map, even if you just have to sketch something really quick.
* Use 3 minute combat timer!
* Tell the players what the DCs are of checks they do
* NPC voices!

### Notes for the Future

* Connect Stoot with the Skinsaw Cult somehow
* Have Tsuto come back missing a leg

### Q&A

* Why did Tsuto want to talk to Ameiko?
  * To talk her into joining Nualia's band
* Was Father Tobyn Nualia's real father?
  * Nah. Interesting, but it adds unnecessary complications

### Silly notes

* Choppy McJervis
* Introduce a character named Red Herring
* Fancifer the Vicarious
* Utharu the Dickish (goblin chief?)
* Cappy Pasta, an infamous source of dubious knowledge
