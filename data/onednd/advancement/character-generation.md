# Determining Your Origin

After choosing your character's Class, it's time to consider the character's origin. Who are the character's ancestors? And how did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? To help answer those questions, you choose three things for the character:

* a Race
* a Background
* a language

A character's Race represents ancestry and confers game traits to the character. A character's Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The Character Origin Overview table lists the traits your character gains from Race and Background.

#### Character Origin Overview

| Race Trait     | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Creature Type  | Every character and monster in the game has a Creature Type.                                                        |
| Size           | A character's Size determines the amount of space the character occupies.                                           |
| Speed          | Speed fuels a character's movement.                                                                                 |
| Life Span      | This life span is an average for a member of the Race -- assuming the dangers of adventure don't shorten that span! |
| Special Traits | Each Race provides special traits -- a collection of abilities that characters gain from their ancestors.           |

| Background Trait    | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ability Score Bonus | A Background grants a +2 bonus to one ability score and a +1 bonus to a different one.                |
| Skill Proficiencies | You get two Skill Proficiencies from a Background.                                                    |
| Tool Proficiency    | Each Background gives Tool Proficiency with one tool.                                                 |
| Language            | A character learns one language from a Background.                                                    |
| Feat                | Each Background provides a 1st-level Feat -- a special ability acquired in the character's past.      |
| Equipment           | A Background provides a portion of a character's starting equipment, with the rest coming from Class. |

Race and Background together help bring your character's backstory into focus, and they distinguish the character from other members of the same Class. For example, two characters might both be members of the Fighter Class, but if one is a Human Guard and the other is a Dwarf Gladiator, the two bring different capabilities and flavor to the Class.

After choosing a Race and a Background, you choose a language that your character knows, in addition to the Common tongue and whatever language you gained from the Background you chose.

The combination of Race, Background, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination, as you ponder your character's earliest days and imagine the character's family, occupation, hometown, and more.

# Character Races

**Children of Two Humanoid Races**

Humanoids of different races sometimes have children together. For example, people who have a human parent and an orc or an elf parent are particularly common. Many other combinations are possible.

If you'd like to play the child of such a pairing, choose two Race options that are Humanoid to represent your parents. Then determine which of those Race options provides your game traits: Size, Speed, and special traits. You can then mix and match visual characteristics -- color, ear shape, and the like -- of the two options. For example, if your character has a halfling and a gnome parent, you might choose Halfling for your game traits and then decide that your character has the pointed ears that are characteristic of a gnome.

Finally, determine the average of the two options' Life Span traits to figure out how long your character might live. For example, a child of a halfling and a gnome has an average life span of 288 years.

When you choose your character's Race, you determine whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. This document provides descriptions and rules for the following Race options: 

* [[[race:Human]]]
* [[[race:Ardling]]]
* [[[race:Dragonborn]]]
* [[[race:Dwarf]]]
* [[[race:Elf]]]
* [[[race:Gnome]]]
* [[[race:Halfling]]]
* [[[race:Orc]]]
* [[[race:Tiefling]]]

The description of each Race includes a section of game traits, which your character gains if you select that Race. NPCs of the same ancestry don't necessarily have the same traits, as explained in the Monster Manual; the traits here pertain to player characters.
