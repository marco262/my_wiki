***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The assassin deals an extra 14 ({@dice 4d6}) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't {@condition incapacitated} and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
