Negotiations have broken down and the goblins have drawn their blades. Before they can take a step towards her, the auri woman unleashes a lethal bullet from her gunblade, causing the goblins to squall and retreat from this unknown weaponry.

An exhausted machinist puts the finishing touches on their newest creation. They flip the switch and the small tower-shaped machine takes flight. It receives its commands and a tiny pistol lets loose a bullet, destroying the target. A smile spreads across the master tinkerer's face.

As the dragon draws in breath in preparation for a mighty spume of fire, a lalafell man throws wide his hand and sends his turret flying to his martial companion. With a few well-timed shots on their enemy, aether flickers into a shield just in time for the flame to wash harmlessly over them.

Artificers have spent many hours in the workshop to progress the art of war. From the creation of firearms, to the production of mechanical constructs for the battle field, the artificer ensure the gears of war continue to turn ever efficiently.

## Forefront of Innovation
An artificer is an incredibly skilled artisan who explores the boundaries of magic and technology. They build special firearms, armor, and machines to aid in defense of their home and country. Unfortunately, with magitek having been developed in Garlemald, few trust an Artificer's innovations &mdash; but those who befriend an Artificer will find them to be brilliant and passionate geniuses.

## In the Name of Advancement
The first step of an artificer's path is developing an aetherconverter. This device draws out the latent magic energy within the artificer and uses it to power their devices. With their power source being intimately connected to their own aether signature, none but the Artificer themself can field test their own creations. As adventurers, this is often the drive of an artificer: to push their equipment and rework it on a long journey in the name of science and innovation.

## Adjustments
The following adjustments have been made to artificers for this campaign.
### Proficiencies
In addition to the base proficiencies provided in the Player's Handbook, artificers of Hydaelyn are proficient in Firearms.

### Equipment
In addition to equipment provided in the Player's Handbook, artificers of Hydaelyn start with an **aetherconverter**. Though a typical artificer's artisan's tools usually function as their spellcasting focus, a Hydaelynian artificer uses their aetherconverter. It must be on your person when you're performing your tinkering magic. 

### Specialties
You may select from the following Specialties:

| Specialty  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Alchemist  | *TCoE* |
|  Combat Medic  | *Homebrew* |
|  Gunbreaker (Armorer) | *Homebrew/TCoE* |
|  Machinist (Artillerist)  | *Homwbrew/TCoE* |


### Specialty Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Specialties to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn.

#### Alchemist
Masters of Science and Nature, the devilish and the divine, alchemists transmogrify mundane materials into wondrous waters &mdash; from curative concoctions to potent potables. 

The Eorzean school of alchemy is a highly selective group &mdash; that is to say, there are few who consider it a legitimate branch of alchemy. Rather, an Eorzean alchemist is more likely to be a mad scientist than a stuffy scholar. Especially with the way they mix aether into their concoctions! But none can argue that upon conducting their symphonies of commixing and combining, distilling and decocting, the impossible waxes possible, and miracles are born. 

#### Artificer Specialty: Combat Medic

A combat medic is an artificer who has developed mechanisms by which to support others in battle beyond their infusions or magic items, keeping their allies' vigor up and prolonging their usefulness in battle.

###### Tool Proficiency
*3rd-level Combat Medic feature*

You gain proficiency with the herbalism kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

##### Combat Medic Spells
*3rd-level Combat Medic feature*

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Combat Medic Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level  | Combat Medic Spells |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  3rd  | *healing word*, *shield of faith* |
|  5th  | *healing spirit*, *warding bond* |
|  9th  | *beacon of hope*, *life transference* |
|  13th  | *aura of purity*, *death ward* |
|  17th  | *circle of power*, *mass cure wounds* |

##### Aether Turret
*3rd-level Combat Medic feature*

You have developed an aetherically-empowered turret that sits sheathed upon your back when not in use. You can mentally command it to float over your shoulder, requiring no action, or return it to your back in the same manner.

Your Aether Turret is a magical ranged weapon that you are proficient with. It deals 1d6 force damage, with a range of 30/120 feet. When attacking with your Aether Turret, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

The Aether Turret's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 9th level (2d6), 13th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

##### Dialysis
*3rd-level Combat Medic feature*

You have learned to achieve an arcane connection with an ally, which lets you channel aether to them during combat to help keep them invigorated and fighting ready. As an action, you choose a willing creature you can see to give them your Dialysis. This link lasts until you give it to another creature, or you finish a long rest.

Whenever you deal damage with your Aether Turret, the creature with your Dialysis gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt.

##### Shielding Tesseract
*5th-level Combat Medic feature*

When you cast an artificer spell, you may choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Roll a d6. Each of those creatures earn that many temporary hit points.

##### Aetheric Charge
*9th-level Combat Medic feature*

When the creature with your Dialysis loses all temporary hit points they have, you gain an Aetheric Charge. You may only ever have one Aetheric Charge at a time, and it dissipates when you finish a short or long rest.

You have two options for how to expend your Aetheric Charge:

* **Turret Overcharge.** When you attack with your Aether Turret, you can expend your Aetheric Charge to increase its damage by 2d6.
* **Aether Bomb.** As an action, you can expend your Aetheric Charge and choose a point within 30 feet of you. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw vs your spell save DC. A creature takes 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you damage any creature with this ability, the creature with your Dialysis gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the number you rolled for damage.  

##### Expedient Aid
*15th-level Combat Medic feature*

You have learned to manage your efforts to provide assistance to your allies faster than ever. You can make a weapon attack, throw an Aether Bomb, or cast an artificer spell as a bonus action, rather than an action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Gunbreaker
*Renamed from Armorer.*

Gunbreaker artificers are enthusiastic battlers who design their entire kit, from armor to weapon. They wield gunblades, which combines a sword with a firing mechanism and emits a range of magical effects by utilizing aetherically imbued cartridges. Not only do their aetherically-charged bullets pack a wallop, but they can be fired into the blade to enhance their cutting power and the force of their strikes. Finally, they can use their gunpowder to fire a defensive barrier that can protect the wielder and their allies from harm.

The **_Guardian's_** special weapon is replaced with:

**The Titanbronze.** You have a gunblade with a large blade that transmits a crackling energy when it strikes a foe. It deals 1d8 lightning damage on a hit. A creature hit by the Titanbronze has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the blade emits a maddening zap when the creature attacks someone else.

The **_Infiltrator's_** special weapon is replaced with:

**Manatrigger.** You have a gunblade specialized in ranged attacks. It counts as a simple ranged weapon with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 50 feet, and it deals 1d6 force damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 force damage to that target.

At 3rd level, gunbreakers gain the following ability: Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with firearms.

#### Machinist
*Renamed from Artillerist.*

Where all artificers are proficient in firearms, machinists specialize in using their firearms in conjunction with magic to incredible effect. Machinists works tirelessly on the development of advanced armaments and new and devastating weapons to bring to the fray.  Armed with their signature firearms and a repertoire of technological marvels, machinists deploy their auto-turrets to deal massive damage on the field.

For your tool proficiency, gain proficiency with **smith's tools** instead of woodcarver's tools.

An machinist's **Eldritch Cannon** is flavored as an auto-turret rather than a cannon.

Their 5th level feature, **Arcane Firearm** is replaced with the following:

If you don't already have a firearm, you create one with your smith's tools. Your extensive knowledge of firearms allows you to juryrig any wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use smith's tools to affix the proper equipment onto a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. You only have enough in your kit for one modification at a time. If you modify a different item, the previous item falls apart. The modification otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.
