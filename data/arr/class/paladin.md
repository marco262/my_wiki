Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a hyur lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man's wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.

A roegadyn crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches a sahagin war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two fishbacks are dead before they even realize he is there.

Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an auri laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.

Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god's altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

A free paladin has no master. Instead she travels all lands, and in every place takes up the cause of the unarmed and defenseless. She swears fealty not to a lord, but to herself â”€ she is nobility amongst adventurers.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, paladins in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

### The Power of Oaths
Like the pure conviction that a cleric displays, a paladin must believe fervently in their oath. Scholars have studied the source of a cleric's or paladin's power, but little headway has been made into the mysteries of conviction.

#### Paladin Oaths
You may select from the following Paladin Oaths:

| Oaths  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Oath of Heroism  | *UA* |
|  Oath of Redemption  | *XGtE* |
|  Oath of Vengeance  | *PHB* |

### Oath Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Oaths to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn.

#### Oath of Heroism
You are truly the champion of Hydaelyn. The Mothercrystal has called to you, spoken to you, and gifted you her blessing. Your blessing, however, is stronger than most, and you are ready to conquer the forces of darkness for the good of the star.

#### Oath of Redemption
An Eorzean redemption paladin is connected to the belief in the inherent goodness of all people. Rather than being flavored with the wilds, you channel the Light, and your inherent warmth and optimism. It is not always easy to maintain your rosy spectacles in this harsh and unforgiving world. But by the Twelve, you try!

#### Oath of Vengeance
A paladin with an oath of vengeance is a dangerous beast indeed: they are concerned not with what is lawful but what is ethical. It is due to their extralegal ambitions and their often dark and brooding nature that many call vengeance paladins "Dark Knights." 

A Dark Knight is a knight who has taken up arms to serve the downtrodden. They serve no lords or institutions, believing no one is exempt from justice, no matter what their position in society. They protect the commonfolk from not only banditry and wild beasts, but from corrupt men who seek to oppress them.
