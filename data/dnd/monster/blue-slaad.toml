***Multiattack.*** The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 8} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}12 ({@damage 2d6 + 5}) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 ({@dice 3d6}) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a {@spell wish} spell can reverse the transformation.
