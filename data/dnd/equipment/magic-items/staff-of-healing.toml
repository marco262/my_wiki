While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: <em>_[[[spell:cure wounds]]]_</em> (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), <em>_[[[spell:lesser restoration]]]_</em> (2 charges), or <em>_[[[spell:mass cure wounds]]]_</em> (5 charges).</p><p>The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.</p>"
