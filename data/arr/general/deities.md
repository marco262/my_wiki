## The Twelve
The Twelve are a pantheon of deities revered by the majority of Eorzea's populace. They are said to have ruled the continent and its surrounding islands until the arrival of wandering tribes. Impressed by the resilience of the primitive settlers, each of the Twelve mercifully saw fit to ensure their welfare.
