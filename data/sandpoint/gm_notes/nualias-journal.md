Master Gandethus gave us an impossible amount of work today. I was in the sitting room trying to finish up when I noticed Amylee and the other girls were snickering about something. They kept looking over at me and playing with their hair. Probably making fun of my white hair. Again.

I did what Master Gandethus said and tried to ignore them, but they wouldn't stop. At lunch, I went and hid in the tool shed for a little while, but when I tried to get out the door was locked. Amylee and her cronies must have locked it! I was locked in there all afternoon, I screamed and screamed but no one helped me. When the sun started to go down, the shed started to get dark, I was scared I was going to die. 

Thank Desna that Mr. Stoot came by and found me! If he didn't need tools to more of his pretty wood birds for the lintels above the windows of the school, I don't think anyone would have come by, and I'd still be stuck in there!

At least, Father let me have extra custard for dessert to make up for it.

Boys are so stupid! A bunch of them were following me as I was walking home from the Academy. They kept whispering to each other, like they always do. Except this time Jeremiah Viskalai came up and talked to me. All he said was he thought my purple eyes were pretty before he and his friends all ran away laughing.

They're so dumb, I know my eyes are ugly. Amylee and her friends always make fun of them. I wish I had normal, blue eyes instead. They're so much prettier. I tried to talk to Father about it, but he just said I'm "blessed" like he always does.

Father and I were talking about what I should do when I finish school. He wants me to become a priest like him. I suppose that would be a good idea. I am blessed, after all, and I'm keeping up with my studies. But to become a proper acolyte, I would have to go study in Magnimar. I've only been there a few times when I was traveling with Father. The city is so big!

The worst part of that plan is I would have to move out of the chapel and make all new friends. Not that I have that many to begin with.
