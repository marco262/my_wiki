Signaling for her companions to wait, a lalafell creeps forward through the pirates' hideout. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.

A viera bends down to run his hand over the gouges on the table. As a ne'er-do-well himself, he knows better than any what a game of Five Finger Fillet looks like: that's what sets him apart from other detectives.

Suppressing a giggle, a miqo'te waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guard's belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.

Just as in any other setting, rogues of Eorzea rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

### Skill and Precision
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them while adventuring such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

### Balanced on a Blade
Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves' guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where giant puddings and cancerous oozes haunt the sewers.

In Limsa Lominsa, however, there are rumors of a small group of rogues and cutthroats hidden within the Dutiful Sisters of the Edelweiss. Sometimes called the Upright Thieves, this group of good-hearted scoundrels enforce General Blofhyswyn's new pirate order — the Code. The Code is as follows: No crew would cheat another of its plunder, nor rob a fellow Lominsan, nor sell fellow men into slavery. And any cove who cross that line is like to meet the wrong end of a blade in an alleyway — or at least find themselves left trussed and humiliated, waiting for the Yellowjackets to clean up your mess.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, rogues in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Roguish Archetypes
You may select from the following Roguish Archetypes:

| Archetype  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| Arcane Trickster | *PHB* |
|  Inspector (Inquisitive)  | *PHB* |
|  Swashbuckler  | *SCAG* |
|  Thief  | *PHB* |

### Archetype Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Archetypes to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn. Any Archetypes that are in the chart above but not listed below are essentially unchanged in their theming.

#### Arcane Trickster
Rounding out the fighter and wizard Red Mage triad, an Arcane Trickster knows more than anything that they need to keep their forbidden magic a secret. They are quick, sneaky, and light on their feet. The only way to accomplish your goals is to stay alive to fight another day!

#### Inspector
*Renamed from Inquisitive.*

You are a crack detective — an inspector extraordinaire. If ever there was a crime to be solved, you would surely be there to crack the case. You have both a sharp eye for detail and a good read on the people around you. You excel at taking down creatures that hide among ordinary folk. Unfortunately, due to the antics of...a certain other party...in your profession, others look on Inspectors with scorn. But you can turn their underestimation into your greatest tool yet!

#### Swashbuckler
While they were partying, *you* were studying the art of the blade. ... But also partying, because let's be real: what's the point of being a great swordsman if you can't dole out the witty quips and banter at the same time? You excel at turning your charm and personality into a weapon as deft as your blade. Swarms of snippers and gads of bad guys aren't really your cup of tea: you are most at home going toe-to-toe in single combat and breaking your foe down one laughing insult at a time.
