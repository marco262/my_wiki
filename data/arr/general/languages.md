Eorzea is home to many different races and cultures. Every race has their own select language and we also see languages separated by region such as seen with the Sharlayans, Dalmascan and Hingashi. Some languages are not in use except for a select few people such as seen with Ancient Sea wolf and the Ascian language. Languages are an important part in the immersive role-playing experience and a crafty story telling technique in the GMs toolbelt.

## The Common Tongue "Hyur"

The most common language in Eorzea is simply known as the common tongue or referred to as "Hyur", barely half of the population of Eorzea is able to read or write. The Eorzean language is also spoken among beast tribes, although many have their own ticks and quirks about it. It has its own script that resembles latin and you can swap out latin characters with Eorzean script.  Every race and culture can speak this language.

The script used for this common tongue is shown below.
