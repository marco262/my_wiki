**Primary Ability:** Strength or Dexterity

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries -- as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every Fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, and use a bow. Fighters master various weapon techniques, allowing them to get the best use from a wide variety of weapons, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants everywhere.

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a Fighter. There are great risks but also great rewards: gold, magic weaponry, and glory.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in one of the Fighter's primary abilities, Strength or Dexterity, to take a level in this Class or to take a level in another Class if you are already a Fighter.

***Proficiencies.*** If Fighter isn't your initial Class, you gain proficiency with Martial Weapons when you take your first Fighter level.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Fighter level, you gain armor training with the following: Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Shields.

## Fighter Class Features

As a Fighter, you gain the following Class Features when you reach the specified levels in this Class. These features are listed on the Fighter table.

### 1st Level: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess and gain the Fighting Style: Defense feat, or you gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice. 

### 1st Level: Second Wind

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to recover from harm. As a Bonus Action, you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 + your Fighter level. You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter table. 

### 1st Level: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [Mastery](/onednd/general/equipment#mastery-properties) property of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change the kinds of weapons you chose.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter table. 

### 2nd Level: Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, chosen from the following action options: Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Dodge. Once you use this feature, you must finish a Short Rest or Long Rest before you can use it again. 

### 3rd Level: Fighter Subclass

You gain the [Champion](/onednd/subclass/Champion) subclass or another Fighter subclass of your choice. Other subclasses will appear in future _Unearthed Arcana_ articles.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Fighter level and lower. This class's description tells you the levels when your subclass provides features. 

### 4th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 5th Level: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

### 5th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Fighter subclass. 

### 7th Level: Weapon Expert

You have honed your use of weapons to an art. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can choose one of the kinds of Mastery weapons you're using and replace its Mastery property with another Mastery property. The chosen kind of weapon must qualify for the new property. For example, you could replace the Longsword's Flex property with the Push property.

This property change applies only for you, not for others, and the change ends for you when you finish your next Long Rest. 

### 8th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 9th Level: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest. 

### 10th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Fighter subclass. 

### 11th Level: Two Extra Attacks

Your Extra Attack feature now confers two extra attacks rather than one. 

### 12th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 13th Level: Weapon Adept

You are a master of weapons. When you use your Weapon Expert feature on a kind of weapon, you can give that kind of weapon two properties rather than one, but you then use only one property at a time; whenever you make an attack roll against a target with that kind of weapon, you decide which of the two properties applies to that attack. You make this decision before the attack hits or misses.

For example, you could apply the Push and Topple properties to Longswords, and whenever you hit a target with a Longsword, you decide which of those properties to use against the target. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Fighter subclass. 

### 15th Level: Improved Action Surge

You can use Action Surge twice before a rest but no more than once on your turn. 

### 16th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 17th Level: Unconquerable

When you're in great peril, you can tap into a deep well of resilience within yourself. If you fail a saving throw and your Indomitable feature is expended, you can use it again by expending a use of your Second Wind, which also heals you. 

### 18th Level: Three Extra Attacks

Your Extra Attack feature now confers three extra attacks rather than two. 

### 19th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 20th Level: Epic Boon

You gain the following benefits:

**Ability Score Increase.** Choose your Strength or Dexterity score. That score increases by 2, and its maximum is now 30.  
**Epic Boon Feat.** You gain the Epic Boon of Recovery or another Epic Boon feat of your choice.
