description = """
To you, this book is a magical spellbook. To anyone else, the book appears to be a volume of verbose romance fiction. As an action, you can change the book's appearance and alter the plot of the romance.

When found, the book contains the following spells: _[hallucinatory terrain](/dnd/spell/hallucinatory terrain)_, _[major image](/dnd/spell/major image)_, _[mirror image](/dnd/spell/mirror image)_, _[mislead](/dnd/spell/mislead)_, _[Nystul's magic aura](/dnd/spell/Nystul's magic aura)_, _[phantasmal force](/dnd/spell/phantasmal force)_, and _[silent image](/dnd/spell/silent image)_. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.
* When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.
