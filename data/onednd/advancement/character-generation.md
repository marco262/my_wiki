# Choosing Your Class

The first step in choosing your D&D character is to pick their class. A class is like a "job", and it is where the majority of your character's special abilities will come from. Your class plays a large part in defining your role in the game, your strengths, and your weaknesses, so choose carefully. 

You can choose from the following classes when creating your character:

* [Artificer](/dnd/class/Artificer)
* [[[class:Barbarian]]]
* [[[class:Bard]]]
* [[[class:Cleric]]]
* [[[class:Druid]]]
* [[[class:Fighter]]]
* [[[class:Monk]]]
* [[[class:Paladin]]]
* [[[class:Ranger]]]
* [[[class:Rogue]]]
* [[[class:Sorcerer]]]
* [[[class:Warlock]]]
* [[[class:Wizard]]]

# Determining Your Origin

After choosing your character's Class, it's time to consider the character's origin. Who are the character's ancestors? And how did the character spend the years leading up to a life of adventure? To help answer those questions, you choose three things for the character:

* a Race
* a Background
* a language

A character's Race represents ancestry and confers game traits to the character. A character's Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The Character Origin Overview table lists the traits your character gains from Race and Background.

#### Character Origin Overview

| Race Trait     | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Creature Type  | Every character and monster in the game has a Creature Type.                                                        |
| Size           | A character's Size determines the amount of space the character occupies.                                           |
| Speed          | Speed fuels a character's movement.                                                                                 |
| Life Span      | This life span is an average for a member of the Race -- assuming the dangers of adventure don't shorten that span! |
| Special Traits | Each Race provides special traits -- a collection of abilities that characters gain from their ancestors.           |

| Background Trait    | Description                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ability Score Bonus | A Background grants a +2 bonus to one ability score and a +1 bonus to a different one.                |
| Skill Proficiencies | You get two Skill Proficiencies from a Background.                                                    |
| Tool Proficiency    | Each Background gives Tool Proficiency with one tool.                                                 |
| Language            | A character learns one language from a Background.                                                    |
| Feat                | Each Background provides a 1st-level Feat -- a special ability acquired in the character's past.      |
| Equipment           | A Background provides a portion of a character's starting equipment, with the rest coming from Class. |

Race and Background together help bring your character's backstory into focus, and they distinguish the character from other members of the same Class. For example, two characters might both be members of the Fighter Class, but if one is a Human Guard and the other is a Dwarf Gladiator, the two bring different capabilities and flavor to the Class.

After choosing a Race and a Background, you choose a language that your character knows, in addition to the Common tongue and whatever language you gained from the Background you chose.

The combination of Race, Background, and languages provides fertile soil for your imagination, as you ponder your character's earliest days and imagine the character's family, occupation, hometown, and more.

# Races

<div class="phb-sidebar" markdown="1">

**Children of Two Humanoid Races**

Humanoids of different races sometimes have children together. For example, people who have a human parent and an orc or an elf parent are particularly common. Many other combinations are possible.

If you'd like to play the child of such a pairing, choose two Race options that are Humanoid to represent your parents. Then determine which of those Race options provides your game traits: Size, Speed, and special traits. You can then mix and match visual characteristics -- color, ear shape, and the like -- of the two options. For example, if your character has a halfling and a gnome parent, you might choose Halfling for your game traits and then decide that your character has the pointed ears that are characteristic of a gnome.

Finally, determine the average of the two options' Life Span traits to figure out how long your character might live. For example, a child of a halfling and a gnome has an average life span of 288 years.

</div>

When you choose your character's Race, you determine whether your character is a member of the human race or of a fantastical race. This document provides descriptions and rules for the following Race options: 

### Common Races

* [[[race:Dwarf]]]
* [[[race:Elf]]]
* [[[race:Gnome]]]
* [[[race:Halfling]]]
* [[[race:Human]]]

### Uncommon Races

* [[[race:Dragonborn]]]
* [[[race:Goliath]]]
* [[[race:Orc]]]
* [[[race:Tiefling]]]

The description of each Race includes a section of game traits, which your character gains if you select that Race. NPCs of the same ancestry don't necessarily have the same traits, as explained in the Monster Manual; the traits here pertain to player characters.

# Backgrounds

Your character's Background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative for the character before they embarked on a life of adventure.

When you choose a Background, you have three options:

* Build a Background by using the rules in the "Build Your Background" section.
* Select a premade Background from the "Sample Backgrounds" section.
* Select a premade Background from the "Sample Backgrounds" section and then customize it with the rules in the "Build Your Background" section.

No matter which Background you choose, consider these questions from your character's viewpoint:

* How does your Background influence your current worldview?
* Do you embrace or reject your Background?
* Did you form any relationships during your Background that endure today?

## Build Your Background

Using the rules here, you can build a Background from scratch or customize a premade Background, focusing on details related to the backstory you have in mind for your character.

When you build a Background, your character gains the features in the "Background Features" section below. As you make choices for those features, think about your character's past. Where did they spend most of their time? What did they do for a living? What capabilities and possessions did they acquire? What language did they learn from their family, associates, or studies? How did their past affect their ability scores?

If you instead decide to customize a premade Background, you can choose any features in that Background and replace them with the features below of the same name. For example, if you want to change a Background's Language feature, you can replace that feature with the Language feature below.

### Background Features

**Ability Scores.** When you determine your character's ability scores, choose two of them, and increase one by 2 and the other one by 1. Alternatively, choose three ability scores, and increase each of them by 1.  
**Skill Proficiencies.** Choose two [Skills](/dnd/general/Using Ability Scores#skills). Your character gains Proficiency in them.  
**Tool Proficiency.** Choose one [[[general:equipment#tools|Tool]]]. Your character gains Tool Proficiency with it.  
**Language.** Choose one language from the [Standard Languages](#standard-languages) or [Rare Languages](#rare-languages) tables. Your character knows that language.  
**Feat.** Choose one 1st-level [[[advancement:feats|Feat]]]. Your character gains that Feat.  
**Equipment.** Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting [[[general:equipment]]]. The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

## Sample Backgrounds

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**Editor's Note**

The sample backgrounds that provide the Magic Initiate feat have been changed from their form in the playtest document to instead provide access to a specific class' spell list. This change was made because the latest playtest documents appear to be moving away from the Arcane/Divine/Primal spells lists and back to class-specific spell lists. 

</div>

Here is a collection of sample Backgrounds that you can choose from when making a character. These Backgrounds were built using the rules in the "Build Your Background" section, and each of them contains story-oriented details that are meant inspire you as you think of your character's backstory.

You devoted yourself to service in a temple, either nestled in a town or secluded in a sacred grove. There you performed hallowed rites in honor of a god or pantheon. You served under a priest and studied religion. Thanks to your priest's instruction and your own devotion, you also learned how to channel a modicum of divine power in service to your place of worship and the people who prayed there.

You began mopping floors and scrubbing counters in an artisan's workshop for a few coppers per day as soon as you were strong enough to carry a bucket. When you were finally old enough to apprentice, you learned to create basic crafts of your own, as well as how to sweet-talk the occasional demanding customer.

**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#skilled|Skilled]]]

Soon after you were old enough to order an ale, you already had a favorite stool in every tavern within ten miles of where you were born. As you traveled the circuit from public house to watering hole, you learned to prey on the unfortunates who were in the market for a comforting lie or two -- perhaps a sham potion or a forged "treasure map." You are fluent in Infernal, the ancient language of deception.

You learned to earn your coin in dark alleyways, cutting purses or burgling shops. Perhaps you were part of a small gang of like-minded wrongdoers, who looked out for each other.

You scarcely recall what drove you into the service of the otherworldly being. Those memories were blotted out long ago by recurrent dreams of midnight gatherings round the obsidian pillar in the glade. By the light of each waning moon, the hierophants instructed you in the being's creed and the rudiments of the arcane arts. When you came of age, you were ordered to blend in among the nonbelievers and await whatever mission the Great One has in store for you.

You spent much of your youth following roving fairs and carnivals, performing odd jobs for musicians and acrobats in exchange for lessons.

To this day, you thrive on applause and long for the stage.

**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#tough|Tough]]]

You grew up close to the land. Years tending animals and cultivating the earth rewarded you with patience and good health.

**Language:** Orc  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#savage-attacker|Savage Attacker]]]

Your first few appearances in the gladiatorial pits led you to appreciate every one of the scars you carry from your instructors and sparring partners. Each scar was a lesson that taught you how to best your opponents and curry favor with the crowds your brawls entertained. Your time in the pits left you with a strong hand and a strong heart. You'll forever share a remarkable bond with the other pit fighters in your stable -- humans, dragonborn, dwarves, and orcs -- hardened warriors all.

**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#alert|Alert]]]

Your feet begin to ache when you remember the countless hours you spent at your post in the tower. You were trained to keep one eye outside the wall, watching for marauders sweeping from the nearby forest, and your other eye inside the wall, searching for cutpurses and troublemakers. At the end of each shift, you bunked in the mayor's barracks alongside your fellow sentries and the dwarven smiths who kept your armor snug and your weapons sharp.

***Equipment***

* Crossbow Bolt (20)
* Gaming Set (same as above)
* Hooded Lantern
* Light Crossbow

**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#magic-initiate|Magic Initiate]]] (Ranger)

You came of age in the outdoors, far from settled lands. Your home? Anywhere you chose to unfurl your bedroll. There are wonders on the frontier -- strange monsters, pristine forests and streams, overgrown ruins of great halls once trod by giants -- and you learned to fend for yourself as you explored them. From time to time, you traveled with a pair of friendly druids who were kind enough to instruct you in the fundamentals of channeling the magic of the wild.

***Equipment***

* Arrow (20)
* Bedroll
* Cartographer's Tools
* Fishing Tackle

You spent your early years secluded in a hut or monastery located well beyond the outskirts of the nearest settlement. In those days, your only companions were the creatures of the forest, who would occasionally visit to bring news of the outside world and supplies. The quiet and solitude you found in your time outside society allowed you to spend many hours pondering the mysteries of creation, attuning your mind to the magical energy flowing through the natural world.

***Equipment***

* Fishing Tackle
* Herbalism Kit
* Lamp
* Oil (3 flasks)

**Language:** Dwarvish  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#tough|Tough]]]

Your apprenticeship consumed the better part of your youth. First, you learned to cut and polish a stone. After several years of polishing stones, you learned how to cement those stones into a wall. After several years building walls, you learned to join your walls to form a structure. The structures you built were exceptionally durable. The masons who taught you were taught by even older masons who were taught by dwarf artisans of old.

***Equipment***

* Bullseye Lantern
* Common Clothes
* Handaxe
* Light Hammer
* Mason's Tools
* Mess Kit
* Oil (1 flask)

**Tool Proficiency:** Gaming Set (one of your choice)  
**Language:** Draconic  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#skilled|Skilled]]]

You were raised in a castle as a creature of wealth, power, and privilege -- none of it earned. Your family are minor aristocrats who saw to it that you received a first-class education, some of which you appreciated and some of which you resented. (Was it truly necessary to read all those ancient histories in their original Draconic?) Your time in the castle, especially the many hours you spent observing your family at court, also taught you a great deal about leadership.

***Equipment***

* Fine Clothes
* Gaming Set
* Perfume
* Signet Ring
* 24 GP

### Pilgrim

**Ability Scores:** +2 Wisdom, +1 Constitution  
**Skill Proficiencies:** Religion, Survival

**Language:** Halfling  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#healer|Healer]]]

You and a group of like-minded believers -- mostly humans and halflings -- once endeavored to walk a thousand miles of road to reach a faraway shrine. Priests counseled at the outset that, long after your journey was complete, you'd come to realize that you found the key to your salvation not at your destination, but somewhere along the road that led there.

***Equipment***

* Bedroll
* Healer's Kit
* Holy Symbol
* Musical Instrument

**Language:** Elvish  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#magic-initiate|Magic Initiate]]] (Wizard)

You spent your formative years traveling between manors and monasteries, performing various odd jobs and services in exchange for access to their libraries. You wiled away many a long evening with your nose buried in books and scrolls, learning the lore of the multiverse -- even the rudiments of magic -- and your mind only yearns for more.

***Equipment***

* Book (History)
* Calligrapher's Supplies
* Parchment (8 sheets)
* Quarterstaff
* Robe
* 8 GP

### Sailor

**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#tavern-brawler|Tavern Brawler]]]

Thus far, you've spent most of your days living the life of a seafarer, wind at your back and decks swaying beneath your feet, as you sailed toward your next adventure. You've perched on barstools in more ports of call than you can remember, faced down mighty storms, and swapped stories with the folk who live beneath the waves.

***Equipment***

* Dagger
* Fishing Tackle
* Navigator's Tools
* Silk Rope
* Traveler's Clothes
* 10 GP

### Soldier

**Ability Scores:** +2 Strength, +1 Constitution  
**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation  
**Tool Proficiency:** Gaming Set (one of your choice)  
**Language:** Goblin  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#savage-attacker|Savage Attacker]]]

You began training for war at such an early age that you carry only a precious few memories of what life was like before you took up arms. Battle is in your blood. Sometimes you catch yourself reflexively performing the basic fighting exercises you learned as a youth. Eventually, you put that training to use on the battlefield, protecting the realm by waging war and studying the strategies of goblinoid generals.

***Equipment***

* Arrow (20)
* Gaming Set (same as above)
* Healer's Kit
* Quiver
* Shortbow
* Spear
* Traveler's Clothes

**Tool Proficiency:** Thieves' Tools  
**Language:** Common Sign Language  
**Feat:** [[[advancement:feats#lucky|Lucky]]]

You grew up on the streets, surrounded by similarly ill-fated castoffs, a few of them friends and a few of them rivals. You slept where you could and did odd jobs for food. At times, when the hunger became unbearable, you resorted to theft. Still, you never lost your pride and never abandoned hope. Fate is not yet finished with you.

***Equipment***

* Bedroll
* Common Clothes
* Dagger (2)
* Gaming Set
* Pouch
* Thieves' Tools
* 18 GP

# Languages

The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread on D&D worlds in the Material Plane, and the Rare Languages table lists languages that are more rarely known on those worlds. In each table, typical users of a language are mentioned.
