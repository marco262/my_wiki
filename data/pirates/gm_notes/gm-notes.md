## Notes

* The players need to find the Dread Pirate Lord's first mate, who is hiding on the Dread Pirate Lord's HQ island.
    * She's a half-elf, so she has not aged as much as everyone else. Maybe a cleric so she can create food and shelter for herself?
    * Knows Scry, but doesn't have a focus. Quest for players later?
    * Stays on the HQ island, because she's been foiling the Knights of Twilight's attempts to uncover the DPL's treasure for 50 goddamn years
* Players need to search for the first mate but have no idea where she is:
    * Need ideas on where to find her (need informants, guides)
    * Need access to the islands for either exploration or just getting to the first mate
* The players' options for getting to the island are:
    * Buy/steal a boat: Easiest but dangerous. The waters beyond the shoreline are not safe, because of pirates, wildlife, and weather.
    * Buy/steal a ship: Much safer but much more difficult. Will need to overpower a whole crew, and then manage the ship themselves.
    * Swim/fly: Dangerous (see Buying a Boat) and tiring. But doable, especially if Rek carries Azurhel.
* Each of the lieutenants has magical gear that is secretly cursed, so that the Dread Pirate Lord can shut them down if they try to turn on him. Give these items to the players.
* Dread Pirate HQ has been taken over by the Knights of Twilight and is strictly off-limits to anyone.
    * Knights of Twilight are trying to pop open a vault that was recently uncovered, which contains powerful treasure that the Dread Pirate is trying to lead the players to.

### Ways to Get Money

* Working (lol)
* Stealing
* Goblin ears
* Caravan guards
* Running cons with Azurhel
* Delivery quests from mainland towns to nearby islands

### Costs

* [Vessels](/dnd/general/equipment#mounts-and-vehicles)
* Ship's passage:
    * Mainland: 1 gp
    * First islands: 1 gp
    * Second islands: 5 gp
    * Third islands: 25 gp
    * HQ island: 100 gp (but all ships are banned from landing there by the Knights of Twilight)
    * Outside the map: 20 gp to nearest ports
    * Hazard pay: 10x

## Player Plans

Go to Everbrook to make money/avenge Azurhel

## TODO

### Before next session

* Get visual aid images for
    * Everbrook
* Figure out what people Azurhel stole from and how much more money they have
* Figure out who else can be stolen from in Everbrook
* Create a grab bag of NPCs, at least 5
* Add distance legend to the world map

### Later...

* Design at least two islands
    * HQ island has a VOLCANO! :O
* Figure out what the Dread Pirate Lord can provide, other than quests
    * Advantage on skill checks, esp. knowledge checks
* Make Knights of Twilight part of the forces of the local kingdom
* Remake map to have multiple "layers" of islands (3-4) with the HQ island as the last one.
    * Progressively more dangerous waters between layers

## Hooks to keep in mind

* Have the Dread Pirate Lord drop hints to a great treasure hidden in the depths of his HQ
* Introduce Knights of Twilight as elite guard that are very dangerous to cross
* Plant seeds of Dread Pirate Lord's lieutenants having powerful magic items and cool ships
* Find ways to emphasize dangers of the sea before they have to fight it
* String quests together (e.g. during goblin hunting, plant hook to another quest)
    * Hooks in some quests can be just partial hooks to later quests; need multiple hooks to get later quests
* Drop connections in some places to history of raiding/connection to lieutenants
* Come up with stories of the Dread Pirate Lord when he was a youngin that he can use or advice or parables
