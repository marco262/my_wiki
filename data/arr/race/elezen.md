The Elezen are a race divided within themselves, and their often arrogant attitudes keep the other races at an arms reach. The Wildwood live off the lush forests, using their keen eyes to hunt and gather in the dense woods. The Duskwights in contrast are notorious for thievery and pillaging, being the victims of prejudice within the Twelveswood. The Ishgardians have done away with the forest and founded an oligarchy and city state in Northern Eorzea.

## Elegance and Pride

Long legs, slender bodies, pointed ears and sharp features are all marks of an Elezen. Only rivaling their otherworld appearance is the poise with which they carry themselves. Their tall, thin frames only differ within the race by the colour of their skin.

**Arrogance or Confidence?**

The Elezen strongly believe in their abilities and their birthrights. Many races may see this as arrogance, but if you are able to see past their haughty attitudes, you will find a steadfast and reliable ally.

## Difference of Opinion

The Elezen race is divided due to their pride. The Wildwood and Duskwights found they could not coexist and distanced themselves from one another. The Wildwood believing they are the true rulers of the forests in which they live and hold dominion. The Duskwights, who historically made their homes in the cavern systems of the forests have rejoined the surface but are eyed with great prejudice by their Wildwood brethren. The Ishgardians were a separate group of Elezen who founded a city state in the North and have a totally unique culture of their own, closed off from the rest of the world.

## The Woods and the North

The forest which the Elezen live is the Black Shroud, a massive forest brought to order by the Wildwood, who protect the forest from poachers and other threats which would encroach on it. Duskwights, who disregard the need to protect the forest and hunt to their content. Looking to the Northern city state of Ishgard, towering spires, homes and a grand cathedral hide behind their giant gates. Living conditions in Ishgard are rough, as the poor go hungry in the lower levels of the city, while the wealthy live in exuberance, looking down on the less fortunate citizens, ruled by the religious teachings of the Holy See.

## Honour and Vengeance

An Elezen may set out on an adventure for many different reasons. An Ishgardian hungry for revenge against the dragons may set out to seek greater strength, while a Wildwood may take up arms to defend their forest home from an encroaching threat against the Black Shroud. Duskwights may set out to gain honour and riches to support their family or to prove to the world they are more than just a thief. Perhaps you seek glory in battle, and head out to find this fame.

## Elezen Names

Both the Wildwood and Duskwight clans of Elezen spell their names very similarly. Men's names are longer and always in -loix, -aux, -mont, or -geant. A female's name will always end in -ne, -ette, -elle, or -ie.

Despite the similarity in their first names, the Elezen tribes over time claimed sur names for either side. These surnames will never cross clans, but only those who live within the race will know the difference.
