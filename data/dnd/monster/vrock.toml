***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

***Beak.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}10 ({@damage 2d6 + 3}) piercing damage.

***Talons.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 6} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}14 ({@damage 2d10 + 3}) slashing damage.

***Spores {@recharge}.*** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, a target takes 5 ({@damage 1d10}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a {@dc 14} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition stunned} until the end of the vrock's next turn.
