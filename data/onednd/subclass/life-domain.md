The Life Domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy -- one of the fundamental forces of the universe -- that sustains all life. The Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that force of life to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is associated with agricultural deities, sun gods, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the powers of this domain. 

### 3rd Level: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain Spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed Spells prepared. These Spells don't count against the number of Spells you can prepare, and they follow the rules of this Class's Spellcasting feature.

### 3rd Level: Disciple of Life

Your healing Spells are empowered by life itself. When a Spell you cast with a Spell Slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the Spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the Spell's level. 

### 6th Level: Preserve Life

You can use your Channel Divinity to heal a group of the critically injured. As an Action, you expend one use of your Channel Divinity and present your Holy Symbol, restoring a number of Hit Points equal to 5 times your Cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of yourself (you can choose yourself), and divide those Hit Points among the chosen creatures. This feature can bring a creature's current Hit Points to no more than half its Hit Point Maximum. 

### 10th Level: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell with a Spell Slot on another creature that restores Hit Points to it, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the Spell's level on the turn you cast the Spell. 

### 14th Level: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a Spell that you cast with a Spell Slot, don't roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a Spell, you restore 12.
