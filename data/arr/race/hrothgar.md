*During the Third Astral Era, Queen Gunnhildr<br>united the fragmented tribes of Hrothgar to rise up and<br>drove off the Allagans, eventually going on to found the nation of Bozja.*

&mdash; Sunja, Hrothgari Priestess
When the Allagan Empire arose in the Third Astral Era, the hrothgar were only disparate, fragmented tribes. However, the Empire's swift march against their people led Queen Gunnhildr to unite the fierce, leonid people to fight against them. On victory, they founded their nation of Bozja, but realized how stark their isolation had been: they had no common tongue with the peoples of Eorzea. They were mistrusted and feared. However, as some hrothgar broke away from their native lifestyle to roam the world and learn more of their neighbors, their worldly reputation quickly improved as others found what friendly and loyal people they were. Though the common tongue is still difficult for many hrothgar, those that make their living outside of native Bozja have a much easier time of it.

### Claws, Fur and Fury
The hrothgar are a powerful people who boast broad frames, feline reflexes, and a fierce appearance punctuated by sharp claws and pointed fangs. However, their race suffers from the disparity in birthrates between genders: hrothgar are overwhelmingly more likely to be male than female. As a result, they adopted a matriarchy in their homeland. Though many supported this structure, many others chose to embrace an independent life instead.

### A Question of Servitude
As their ways came into conflict, the Hrothgar split into two distinct groups of people: the Helions and the Lost. The Helions, who are easily identified by the warm colors of their fur, are found mainly in the southern parts of their homeland. In general, Helions' lives revolve around their queen: the many males are devout servants, while the rare females serve as the queen's priestesses.

The Lost, unbound from the whims of a queen, boast a free-spirited, nomadic lifestyle. As nomads, they often take up professions from mercenary to merchant. The Lost avoid anything that forces them to put roots down.

### War Torn Homeland
The hrothgar hail from Bozja, a tropical region in Southern Ilsabard that was born of their flight from the Allagan Empire in the Third Astral Era. It wasn't until Queen Gunnhildr rose to leadership that the Allagans were held at bay. Ever since, Bozja has been led by one Queen Gunnhildr after another, a title bestowed upon the woman with the greatest aptitude for Future Sight. Due to a terrible accident that all but vaporized its central city, Bozja has become a warzone controlled by the Garlean Empire.

### It's My Life
The hrothgar's philosophical split between servitude and freedom drives these people forward. A Helion may set out for adventure in the name of their queen, whether to protect their homeland or to fulfill her requests. For the Lost, however, adventure is already a mainstay in their day-to-day existence: after all, Hydaelyn's many threats make constant travel dangerous.

### Hrothgar Names
