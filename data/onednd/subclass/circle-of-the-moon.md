Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on the magic of the moon to transform themselves and to guard the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and perform rituals. They wander the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another person, let alone another Druid.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid's blood. 

### 3rd Level: Combat Wild Shape

You have learned magical techniques that allow you to transform quickly and to channel magical protection while transformed, giving you these benefits:

***Abjuration Spells.*** While you're in a Wild Shape form, you can cast any spell you currently have prepared from the Abjuration School, provided the spell doesn't require a material component.

***Quick Attack.*** You can use Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

***Swift Transformation.*** You can use your Wild Shape as a Bonus Action or Magic action, but no more than once on a turn. 

### 6th Level: Elemental Wild Shape

Channeling ancient lunar magic, you imbue your Wild Shape forms with power from the Elemental Planes. Whenever you assume a Wild Shape form, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

While in that form, you have Resistance to the chosen damage type, and the form's Bestial Strike can deal damage of that type rather than its normal type -- with you choosing between the types when you hit.

Your form also displays signs of the chosen damage type. For example, if you choose Fire, your fur in Wild Shape might flicker with harmless flames. You choose the details. 

### 10th Level: Elemental Strike

Elemental forces imbue your attacks. When you deal damage with your Bestial Strike, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the type you chose from Elemental Wild Shape. This extra damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 17th level in this class. 

### 14th Level: Thousand Forms

You have learned to use lunar magic to alter your physical form in innumerable ways. You always have the _[[[spell:Alter Self]]]_ spell prepared, and you can cast it without expending a Spell Slot. It also doesn't count against the number of spells you have prepared.
