***Death Throes.*** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a {@dc 20} Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 ({@damage 20d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.

***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 ({@damage 3d6}) fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The balor's weapon attacks are magical.
