The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.

## Ranger's Companion

At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (See the [[[general:Monsters by Type]]] page for a list of beasts). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. *Your beast companion is proficient in the saving throws of its two highest ability scores. You add your proficiency bonus to any DCs your beast companion may have.*

*At 3rd level, your beast companion's hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or 16, whichever is higher. Every ranger level after that, increase its hit points by 5. Whenever your companion reaches zero hit points, they make death saving throws as per normal rules. Your beast companion has a number of 1d6 hit dice equal to your ranger level. You add your beast's con mod to its own hit die healing, unless the con mod is negative.*

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. *When you use your action to command your beast companion to attack, your action is considered an Attack Action for the purposes of Two Weapon Fighting.*

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.

*You also can cast the Companion Revitalization spell as a ritual.*

**Companion Revitalization**
**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** Touch (Beast Companion Only)
**Components:** S
**Duration:** Instantaneous
    Through a magical bond between you and your beast companion, you share your vitality. Expend any number of your own Ranger hit dice to heal your companion for 1d10 + wisdom modifier for each hit die spent.

## Exceptional Training

Beginning at 7th level, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action on its turn. *On any of your turns when you do not make an attack or cast a spell, you can use your bonus action to command your companion to make a single attack.*

## Bestial Fury

Starting at 11th level, your beast companion can make two attacks when you command it to use the Attack action.

## Share Spells

Beginning at 15th level, when you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.
