## Feature: Ridiculous Requests

[[div id="phb-sidebar"]]

**Can Missives be Ignored?**

In the interest of fun, there is no time limit or consequence if a missive remains incomplete. If player behavior strongly suggests missives will be ignored or discarded, the player will simply lose the benefits of this background's feature.

[[/div]]

At the end of a long rest, and at your DM's determination, a postmoogle may deliver a sealed missive to you. The missive comes from Sharlayan, written by a scholarch whom requests that you procure an item for them. Accompanying the missive is a letter of credit, covering the item's value in case it is purchased, and a lead on where it may be found.

On page 160 of the *Player's Handbook,* roll a d100 on the **Trinkets** table to determine the item requested. You may receive a maximum of three missives at any given time, and each are completed once the specified items are delivered in person. To more easily do so, you are able to secure free passage to and from Sharlayan when traveling by sea. 

Fulfilling missives builds friendly relationships with appreciative scholarchs, who may to offer you payment or seek to return the favor in some way.

## Suggested Characteristics
Gleaning is a daunting and thankless job, though it presents a unique lesson not found in any dusty tome or taught by any pigheaded scholarch - that of worldly experience and the pursuit of discovery.
