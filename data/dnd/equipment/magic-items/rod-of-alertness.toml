description = """
This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.

***Alertness.*** While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.

***Spells.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: _[[[spell:detect evil and good]]]_, _[[[spell:detect magic]]]_, _[[[spell:detect poison and disease]]]_, or _[[[spell:see invisibility]]]_.

***Protective Aura.*** As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any [[[general:conditions#invisible|invisible]]] hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
