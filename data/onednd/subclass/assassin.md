An Assassin's training focuses on the grim art of death, using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While some Rogues who follow this path are hired killers, spies, or bounty hunters, the capabilities of this subclass are equally useful for adventurers facing a variety of monstrous enemies.

### 3rd Level: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with the Disguise Kit and Poisoner's Kit.

### 3rd Level: Assassinate

You are adept at getting the drop on a target, granting you the following benefits:

**Initiative.** You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.  
**Surprising Strikes.** During the first round of each combat, you have Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. If your Sneak Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon's type equal to your Rogue level.

### 9th Level: Infiltration Expertise

You are expert at posing as someone else to aid your infiltrations. While in a disguise created using your Disguise Kit, you have Advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check you make while pretending to be someone else. You can also unerringly mimic another person's speech, handwriting, or both if you have spent at least one hour studying each one.

### 13th Level: Envenom Weapons

When you use the Poison option of your Cunning Strike, the target also takes 2d6 Poison damage whenever it fails the saving throw. This damage ignores resistance to Poison damage.

### 17th Level: Death Strike

When you hit with your Sneak Attack on the first round of a combat, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency Bonus), or the attack's damage is doubled against the target.
