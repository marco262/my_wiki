description = """
This magic shortbow's string, when plucked, rings with a musical note that is like honey to the ears. If you are proficient in stringed instruments, you may play the Heart String Bow as if it were an instrument.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the Heart String Bow.

You can use an action to pluck the bowstring and cast one of its spells: _[[[spell:animal friendship]]]_, _[[[spell:charm person]]]_, _[[[spell:command]]]_, _[[[spell:enthrall]]]_, _[[[spell:sleep]]]_, _[[[spell:suggestion]]]_. Once the bow has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. For spells that require a saving throw, the DC is 15.
