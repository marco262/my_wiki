Whether they are bold champions defending the weak and downtrodden, or merciless raiders seeking might and riches, dragonfire adepts are imposing figures who command the magic of dragonkind. Able to call upon a dragon's fiery breath and augment themselves with spell-like abilities, dragonfire adepts have access to powers normally beyond the reach of humanoids.

Dragonfire adepts have no arcane or divine magic, nor are they masters of martial prowess. Instead, they draw upon a direct link with the nature of draconic existence, infusing their soul with the raw magic of dragons. The most obvious incarnation of this link is their breath weapon, but as they gain experience, dragonfire adepts learn powerful invocations that allow them to access different draconic abilities. Cunning, hearty, and learned, dragonfire adepts can be warleaders or sages with equal ease.

A dragonfire adept is a student devoted to understanding the ways of dragons and emulating them. Evil dragonfire adepts are cruel tyrants who impose their will on others, seeking to control land, build strongholds, and amass vast treasures. Good dragonfire adepts are champions of justice and freedom, using their powers to aid others. Like a sorcerer, a dragonfire adept gains new powers automatically as she rises in level, tapping ever deeper into the draconic magic in her soul. Unlike a sorcerer, however, a dragonfire adept manifests this magic not in the form of spells, but as invocations that emulate draconic powers.

* (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
* Any simple weapon and two daggers

## Otherworldly Patron

At 1st level, you make a choice to follow the ideals of the metallic dragons in the service of Bahamut or to embrace your darker nature and follow Tiamat and her chromatic dragons. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level. Each of these are detailed at the end of the class description.

## Dragon Magic

Your draconic nature grants you a certain facility with spells. See the [[[general:spellcasting rules]]] and the dragonfire adept spell list at the end of the class description.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the dragonfire adept spell list. You learn additional dragonfire adept cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Dragonfire Adept table.

### Spell Slots

The Dragonfire Adept table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your dragonfire adept spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *[[[spell:thunderwave]]]*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the dragonfire adept spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Dragonfire Adept table shows when you learn more dragonfire adept spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new dragonfire adept spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dragonfire adept spells you know and replace it with another spell from the dragonfire adept spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your dragonfire adept spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dragonfire adept spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

* Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
* Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an [[[equipment:adventuring-gear#arcane-focus|arcane focus]]] as a spellcasting focus for your dragonfire adept spells.

## Eldritch Invocations

As you awaken your draconic heritage, you acquire additional facets of draconic mysticism that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two draconic invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain dragonfire adept levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Dragonfire Adept table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

## Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Draconic Secret

At 11th level, your draconic heritage reveals to you a potent magical secret. Choose one 6th-level spell from the dragonfire adept spell list as this secret.

You can cast your secret spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more dragonfire adept spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Draconic Secrets when you finish a long rest.

## Draconic Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of draconic power to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute of inner reflection to regain all your expended spell slots, but not your Draconic Secrets. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

# Draconic Patrons

Your choice of draconic patron greatly influences your abilities as you progress in experience.

### Aspect of the Metallic Dragons
[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]
***Breath Weapon***

Conjuration cantrip
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Range:** 15 feet (cone) or 30 feet (line)
**Components:** None
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You tap into your draconic nature and unleash a raging torrent of energy. Choose the shape and range of this energy when you use it. All creatures in range must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 damage. On a successful save, they take half damage. The save DC for this effect is based on your Constitution modifier. The type of damage is determined by your Draconic Patron choice. This damage increases by 1d8 damage at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
[[/div]]
At 1st level, your choice of Draconic Patron influences your draconic nature at a fundamental level. You must select a type of metallic dragon that you identify with. Your choices are detailed below. You gain a breath weapon that deals damage of the type indicated. You also grow a thin set of scales that match the color of your chosen dragon. These scales give you an AC of 13 + your Dexterity modifier when you aren't wearing armor.


||~ Dragon Type ||~ Damage Type ||
|| Brass || Fire ||
|| Bronze || Acid ||
|| Copper || Lightning ||
|| Gold || Fire ||
|| Silver || Cold ||

### Energy Expertise

At 3rd level, your mastery of your draconic nature improves enough for a secondary breath weapon type to emerge. Consult the table below to determine your new energy type. You cannot select a different dragon than you selected before. Whenever you use your breath weapon, you can select which of your two energy types to use. In addition, you gain resistance to both energy types.

||~ Dragon Type ||~ Damage Type ||
|| Brass || Radiant ||
|| Bronze || Necrotic ||
|| Copper || Thunder ||
|| Gold || Radiant ||
|| Silver || Force ||

### Scintillating Scales

At 6th level, as a reaction in response to being hit with an attack you can stiffen your scales for a short period of time. Starting with the attack that triggered this reaction and lasting for 1 minute, you can add your proficiency bonus to your AC. Once you use this ability, you can not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Greater Aspect of Metallic Dragons

At 10th level, you become immune to paralysis and magical effects that render you unconcious. Additionally, your breath weapon's range is doubled. You may add double your proficiency bonus to any Charisma checks when interacting with metallic dragons, even if you would otherwise not be proficient in them.

### Discorporating Breath of Bahamut

At 14th level, you learn to mimic the effects of the mighty breath weapon of Bahamut. As an action on your turn you can produce a breath weapon that inflicts 10d10 untyped damage to those in range unless they succeed on a dexterity saving throw. Those that do save take half damage. This damage bypasses all resistances and immunities. If a creature is dropped to 0 hit points with this damage, it and all of its non-magical possessions turn to dust. (see the disintegrate spell for details) Once you use this ability, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Tiamat

### Expanded Spell List

||~ Spell Level ||~ Spells ||
|| 1st || *[[[spell:chromatic orb]]]*, *[[[spell: protection from evil and good]]]* ||
|| 2nd || *[[[spell:crown of madness]]]*, *[[[spell: blindness/deafness]]]* ||
|| 3rd || *[[[spell:animate dead]]]*, *[[[spell: vampiric touch]]]* ||
|| 4th || *[[[spell:blight]]]*, *[[[spell: phantasmal killer]]]* ||
|| 5th || *[[[spell:modify memory]]]*, *[[[spell: planar binding]]]* ||

### Aspect of the Chromatic Dragons

At 1st level, your choice of Draconic Patron influences your draconic nature at a fundamental level. You must select a type of chromatic dragon that you identify with. Your choices are detailed below. You gain a breath weapon that deals damage of the type indicated. You also grow a thin set of scales that match the color of your chosen dragon. These scales give you an AC of 13 + your Dexterity modifier when you aren't wearing armor.

||~ Dragon Type ||~ Damage Type ||
|| Black || Acid ||
|| Blue || Lightning ||
|| Green || Poison ||
|| Red || Fire ||
|| White || Cold ||

### Energy Dominance

At 3rd level, your mastery of your draconic nature improves enough for a secondary breath weapon type to emerge. Consult the table below to determine your new energy type. You cannot select a different dragon than you selected before. Whenever you use your breath weapon, you can select which of your two energy types to use. In addition, you gain resistance to both energy types.

||~ Dragon Type ||~ Damage Type ||
|| Black || Necrotic ||
|| Blue || Thunder ||
|| Green || Psychic ||
|| Red || Radiant ||
|| White || Force ||

### Frightful Presence

At 6th level, as a reaction in response to being attacked, you can project the frightful presence of a dragon for a brief moment. All enemies within 30' must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. Any creatures affected by this can attempt a new save at the start of their turn to end the effect. Creatures immune to fear are not affected by this ability. Once you use this feature, you can not do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Greater Aspect of Chromatic Dragons

At 10th level, you become immune to paralysis and magical effects that render you unconscious. Additionally, your breath weapon's range is doubled. You may add double your proficiency bonus to any Charisma checks when interacting with chromatic dragons, even if you would otherwise not be proficient in them.

### Fivefold Breath of Tiamat

At 14th level, you learn to mimic the effects of the mighty breath weapon of Tiamat. You can, as an action on your turn use your breath weapon 5 times simultaneously. Each breath weapon is resolved independently and can be aimed at different targets. Each breath weapon corresponds to one of the five primary energy types: acid, lightning, poison, fire, and cold. Once you use this feature, you can not do so again until you finish a long rest.

# Draconic Invocations

If a draconic invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites.

## Baleful Geas

*Prerequisite: 9th level*

You can cast *[[[spell:geas]]]* once using a dragonfire adept spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Beguiling Influence

You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.

## Breath of the Night

*Prerequisite: 12th level*

You can cast *[[[spell:fog cloud]]]* at-will, without expending a spell slot.

## Draconic Knowledge

You gain proficiency in the Arcana and History skills.

## Draconic Toughness

*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You can cast *[[[spell:false life]]]* on yourself at-will as a 2nd-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.

## Dragon Wings

*Prerequisite: 12th level*

You gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. This ability works exactly like the Draconic Sorcerer ability Dragon Wings.

## Dragonsight

You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

## Endure Exposure

Your breath weapon only affects enemies in range.

## Entangling Exhalation

When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to make it an entangling blast of energy. Your breath weapon deals half its normal damage (which is halved again if the creature saves), but any creature that takes damage becomes restrained for 1d4 rounds. Any creature so restrained takes 1d8 damage of the same type as your breath weapon at the start of its turn. It can use its action to end the effect. It can also attempt a Dexterity check against your breath weapon's save DC to ignore the restrained condition, but not the damage, for the current turn. You can use the ability at-will. Multiple uses of this ability with the same energy type don't stack. Multiple uses of this ability with different energy types overlap for the purposes of the restrained condition, but the damage from all energy sources is resolved independently. A creature can end all entangling breath effects affecting it with an action on its turn.

## Enthralling Voice

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

You can cast *[[[spell:enthrall]]]* at-will, without expending a spell slot.

## Humanoid Shape

*Prerequisite: 15th level*

You can cast *[[[spell:alter self]]]* at-will, without expending a spell slot.

## Lingering Breath

*Prerequisite: 9th level*

When you use your breath weapon you can choose to have it linger as a cloud for 1 round. Any creature that enters or ends its turn inside the cloud takes half normal damage and/or feels the effects of the breath weapon, but only for half the normal duration. You can use this ability at-will.

## Magic Insight

You can cast *[[[spell:detect magic]]]* at will, without expending a spell slot. If you concentrate on a magic item for 1 minute, you learn its properties as if you had cast *[[[spell:]]]*identify on the item.

## Powerful Breath

When you use your Breath Weapon ability, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals to each creature in range.

## Sleep Breath

*Prerequisite: 9th level*

When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to breathe a sleep-inducing gas instead. Your breath weapon deals no damage, and all creatures affected must succeed on a Constitution save or be affected as by the sleep spell. Each creature can attempt a new save each round for the duration (2 rounds) to ignore the sleep effect for that round. You may use this ability at-will.

## Slow Breath

*Prerequisite: 5th level*

When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to breathe a magical slow effect instead. Your breath weapon deals no damage and all creatures affected must succeed on a Strength save or be affected as by the slow spell. Each creature can attempt a new save each round for the duration (2 rounds) to ignore the slow effect for that round. You may use this ability at-will.

## Terrifying Roar

*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You can cast *[[[spell:fear]]]* at will, without expending a spell slot. Your roar has a duration of 2 rounds. Any creature that succeeds on its Wisdom save is immune to your fear spells for 24 hours.

You can cast *[[[spell:dispel magic]]]* once using a dragonfire adept spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Wingstorm

*Prerequisite: 15th level, Dragon Wings invocation*

***Instill Vulnerability***

1st-level Necromancy
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
**Range:** 90 feet
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You project your draconic majesty towards a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, that creature gains vulnerability to one energy type of your choice. If the target is resistant to that energy type, it instead loses that resistance. If the target is immune to that energy, it instead becomes resistant to it. Also, the target has disadvantage on ability checks made to resist your breath weapon.

If the target drops to 0 hit points before the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to instill vulnerability in a new creature.

A remove curse cast on the target ends this spell early.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.
