While attuned to the medallion, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks and saving throws. Once per day, as a free action, you may use the medallion to give yourself 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points.

Placed on the neck of a dead body, a Sihedron medallion preserves the body indefinitely via a _[gentle repose](/dnd/spell/gentle repose)_ effect.
