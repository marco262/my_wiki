***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a {@dc 19} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.*** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a {@dc 21} Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 ({@damage 18d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
