## Xanathar's Guild

1. When one of the PCs is separated from the group, they're mugged by a teenage boy 
(Brendaniel Skwik) with a crossbow and a Kenku shadowing him. If the party attacks, the 
Kenku escapes. The boy tells the group that this was his task to get inducted into the 
Xanathar's Guild.
1. The players come across some Xanathar's Guild members mugging someone in an alley.
1. Tally's shop is wrecked in the middle of the day because he refuses to pay the
Guild's protection money.
1. A thug pushes past the party, trying to get all "Do you know who I am?" on them.
1. Some thugs show up and try to extort protection money from the PCs.

## Zhentarim

1. The party is attacked by a guy high on "magic dust", which is the D&D version of PCP.
It gives the effects of Heroism (immune to fear, 5 temp HP every turn). If the players 
track the source of these drugs down, they find the Zhentarim are responsible.
1. A warehouse nearby is raided and the players witness the City Watch hauling crates
of goods out into wagons. This was a storehouse the Zhentarim were using to store
their stolen goods before selling it.
1. Embric is attacked in the middle of the night by Zhent assassins because he won't
sell weapons exclusively through them.

## Both

1. The Zhentarim and Xanathar's Guild members pass in the street and start throwing insults
at each other before breaking out into a brawl. They scatter if the City Watch is called.
