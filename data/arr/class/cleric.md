Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips to Azeyma, an elezen begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions. 

Bleeding and weary, an auri summons the power of the arcane and the divine together. With one mighty sweep, his companion's wounds knit together and the demon lord's hold on them is broken.

Chanting a song of glory, a roegadyn swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of imperials arrayed against him, shouting praise to Rhalgr with every foe's fall.

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the Twelve. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of the Twelve in the mortal realm. At times the Twelve work through them; others, the cleric manifests the will of their patron god through fervent prayer and iron belief.

### Healers and Warriors
Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and  hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the Twelve on their side.

### Divine Agents
Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. In fact, very very few can be said to have the strength of will and pure certainty that a Cleric needs to manifest the effects their god demands. When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. 

Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, Clerics in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Domains
You may select from the following Cleric Domains:

| Domain  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Arcana  | *SCAG* |
|  Forge  | *XGtE* |
|  Knowledge  | *PHB* |
|  Life  | *PHB* |
|  Light  | *PHB* |
|  Nature  | *PHB* |
|  Order  | *TCoE* |
|  Peace  | *TCoE* |
|  Tempest  | *PHB* |
|  Trickery  | *PHB* |
|  Void (Death)  | *DMG* |
|  War  | *PHB* |

#### Domain Flavors
We suggest the following adjustments to the flavors of the existing Domains to mesh better within the world of Hydaelyn. Any Domains that are in the chart above but not listed below are essentially unchanged in their theming.

##### Arcana
A Cleric who serves the domain of Arcana is an expert in Aether. Under the guidance of the gods, they have learned to tap not only divine power, but that of arcanum too. They are experts at guiding their allies with both powers at hand.

##### Forge
A Cleric of the Forge is most likely to be a follower of Byregot, but a cleric can follow any god that calls to them. Forge clerics devote themselves to channeling their divine power to create relics and artifacts for all of Hydaelyn. 

Like artificers, a Cleric of the Forge makes a good option for a magic-wielding Garlean (or any other race) who has learned to harness technology in service of the greater good.

##### Knowledge
By far the greatest concentration of Knowledge Clerics on Hydaelyn reside in Old Sharlayan. Sharlayans believe it is their  task to observe â€” to chart the course of history, not to change it. Civilization shall not be advanced through petty conflict, but by the passing of recorded knowledge from generation to generation.

##### Life

A Life Cleric's power over life and healing stems from the Lifestream. Their domain tends to focus on healing and balancing vital aether in their targets. The purity of their healing and magic has lent a lot of weight to their title of White Mages.

##### Nature 
Nature Clerics are usually based in the Twelveswood, and represent the Elementals. But though their magic comes from a more earthly source, it is no less White Magic than a Life Cleric's.

A Nature Cleric communes with the world around them, borrowing power from Elementals present throughout the world. They are by and large level-headed, respectful spell casters who are aware that overstepping one's bounds in the world of magic can lead to calamity, and seek to keep order within the magic world.

##### Order
A Cleric of Order is better even than most Clerics at marshaling belief. Their fervent and unyielding prayers tend to bring out the best in their allies, pushing them past their limits to extraordinary effect.

##### Void
*Renamed from Death.*

Void Clerics, sometimes called Reapers, draw their power from a contract with their special voidsent ally, the Void Avatar. Using the gift of a personal macabre memento to channel dark magics, Reapers mix martial prowess with magic pulled from the void itself to bring destruction to evil doers.
