# Downtime

* The players will have a month of downtime (4 weeks)
    * Learning a new language/tool takes 5 weeks instead of 10, so Lyse will get Herbalist Kit proficiency by the end of this downtime.
    * Encourage Delfi to try out Gambling again
* Spread Sandpoint problems out over downtime. Save some businesses/people to leave later when murders happen.
* Social Events
    * Week 1: Soldiers go home
        * Alma will be sad to see Roland go.
        * Emphasize that Hart had a positive impact on the town.
    * Week 2:
        * Lady whose husband got eaten by the goblins returns to Sandpoint to get her stuff. Neighborly get together ensues.
        * Shalelu will hook up with Orik. "He makes me laugh."
        * The Glassworks is cleared enough to be explored. Nothing to find, except further proof Ameiko didn't die lol
        * Aesrick shores up the tunnel and gets the secret door open again, to provide easier access to the Catacombs.
    * Week 3: Lonjiku's funeral
        * Ameiko has inherited the Glassworks, and needs to decide what she'll do with it.
        * She'll decide to rebuild it, to support Sandpoint and carry on her family's legacy.
        * She'll get an offer from [Jubrayl Vhiski](^sandpoint/jubrayl_vhiski.png) to fund it but will turn him down because she knows it comes with strings attached.
    * Week 4: Chapter 2 starts with MURDERS
