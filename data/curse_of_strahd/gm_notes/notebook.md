## Party

[Strahd Squad!](^curse_of_strahd/Strahd_Squad.png)

### Ethel

* Armor Class: 14
* Passive Per: 14
* Passive Ins: 12

Cursed with Lycanthropy

* Around the night of the full moon, Charisma save every 2 hours to resist the Beast inside them.
  * 2 days before (DC 5), 1 day before (DC 10), Night of the full moon (DC 15), 1 day after (DC 10), 2 days after (DC 15)
  * If they fail, they transform into their hybrid form and go on a rampage.
  * While transformed, they can continue to make the save every 2 hours, transforming back on a success.
  * If they choose not to resist the curse, they transform completely and cannot make saves for the rest of the night.
  * Indulging in killing/wanton destruction throughout the night can keep the Beast at bay.

### Orin

* Armor Class: 14
* Passive Per: 14
* Passive Ins: 12

Notes

* All food he eats now tastes like hot borscht (cursed Spoon item from Dragomir)

### Marblepaw

## Journal

* 23: Arrived in the Village of Barovia

## General Notes

* Get more battle/Vallaki/character theme music
* Traumatize Orin/Marblepaw
* Look into possibility of Ireena going to Strahd willingly (and how it will go horribly lol)
* Have Strahd approach Orin to help him win over Ireena
* Do more second/third degree interactions with Strahd
* INTRODUCE THE BRIDES

## Notes for Next Session

### Player Plans

* Ireena is the ritualist
* Ireena has finished the Spring part of the ritual, but the skill challenge for the Spring part has not happened yet

### Notes for me

* Victor will use Modify Memory to "lobotomize" the malcontent carpenter who lost his daughter
* Add to Soundboard:
  * Brody Quest (travel music)
  * Kill Bill Siren
  * Mine is an evil laugh
  * Some sound from Jareth in Labyrinth
  * Kuzco's Poison
* Pull my python-markdown2 library on the media PC
* Read up on Amber Temple
* Have Strahd interact with the players again, and be both charming and vaguely threatening
* After the players have met Strahd again, they'll run into van Richten who will mention the Bride Ceremony 

#### Vallaki
