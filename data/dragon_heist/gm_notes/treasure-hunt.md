## Important Notes

* *Ahghairon's dragonward*
  * Ahghairon was Waterdeep's first Open Lord, and his tower still stands in the Southwest corner of the Castle Ward.
  * In the mid-11th century DR, Ranressa Shiard returned as a hero from her journeys to Waterdeep atop the mighty copper dragon Galadaeros. Although she was welcomed home, the appearance of her mount flying over the city unsettled the majority of the populace. Ahghairon lead a ritual to create *Ahghairon's dragonward* to allay their fears.
  * The dragonward is centered on [Ahghairon's tower](^ahghairons_tower.jpg), and encompasses all of Waterdeep, as far as anyone knows.

## Pink Flumph Theater

* *Kiss of a Lamia* was written by Cecil Weiss
* [Yaliek Iltizmar](^yaliek_iltizmar.jpg), plays the evil prince in *Kiss of a Lamia*

### Bronze Dragon Scale

 * Seen by many sailors and dockworkers
 * Lurking inside a shipwreck 120 feet underwater
 * Still searching for treasure, will try to scare players away. Only fights in self-defense.
 * DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) or 1,000 gp in treasure will convince him to give up one of his scales.
   * If he hears about the treasure, demands 10% of the take

### Private symbol of Dagult Neverember

 * Renaer goes on the hunt for his father's private symbol. 
 * He finds that his father's vacation home in the Sea Ward has been robbed. However, all the stolen loot is in bags still by the door.
 * Renaer does no more exploring, and contacts the party.
 * The study's door has been forced open, despite the very sturdy lock.
 * Robber's corpse is on the ground with a letter opener in his chest.

When the players step in, they have enough to take in the room, and then they notice things start to move. The objects around them slowly come to life and attack them. They need to find the mechanism to shut it off.
