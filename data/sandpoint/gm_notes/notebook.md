## Identifying Magic Items

Thoroughly identifying a magic item requires the Identify spell. 

If no one in the party knows the Identify spell, it will generally be pretty easy to find someone else who can cast it for you, though they may charge you up to 11 gp to cast it, depending on how much they like you. Also, it will still be possible to spend some time playing with an item and learning at least a bit of its function, depending on how obvious it is. You won't risk using up consumable items this way.

Lastly, anyone taking a few moments to inspect a magic item can make an Arcana or History check to see if they have come across the item before, or can use their knowledge of arcane theory to piece together the item's likely purpose.
