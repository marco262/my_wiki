**Primary Abilities:** Dexterity, Wisdom

Far from the bustle of cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch.

Wanderers of the wilderness, Rangers specialize in facing monsters that threaten the world. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness the primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus on the task of protecting the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

## Creating a Ranger

[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]

**Multiclassing and the Ranger**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Ranger as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Ranger's primary abilities, Dexterity and Wisdom, to take a level in this class or to take a level in another class if you are already a Ranger.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If Ranger isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first Ranger level: Martial Weapons and one skill of your choice from the Ranger's skill list.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Ranger level, you gain the following [[glossary:armor training]]: Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Shield.

***Spell Slots.*** Add half your Ranger levels (rounded up) to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots for casting spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare spells for each of your classes individually, referring to the spell slots of an individual class to determine the number and levels of the spells you prepare for it.

[[/div]]

To create a Ranger, consult the following lists, which provide Hit Points, proficiencies, and [[glossary:armor training]]. If you're making a 1st-level character, also consult the [Starting Equipment](#starting-equipment) section, and if you're using the multiclassing rules, see the "Multiclassing and the Ranger" sidebar.

Then look at the Ranger table to see the Class Features you get at each level in this Class. The descriptions of those features appear in the [Ranger Class Features](#ranger-class-features) section.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per Ranger level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points per Level after 1st:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier  

#### Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity  
**Skills (Choose 3):** Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Survival    
**Weapons:** Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons  
**Tools:** None  

#### Armor Training

Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields

### Starting Equipment

As a 1st-level character, you start with the following equipment, or you can forgo it and spend 150 GP on equipment of your choice.

* Arrows (20)
* Druidic Focus (Sprig of Mistletoe)
* Explorer's Pack
* Longbow or Shortbow
* Quiver
* Scimitar
* Shortsword
* Studded Leather Armor
* 7 GP

## Ranger Class Features

As a Ranger, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified levels in this class. These features are listed on the Ranger table.

### 1st Level: Deft Explorer

You are an unsurpassed explorer. Choose one of your proficiencies in a skill that appears on the Ranger skill list. You gain [[glossary:Expertise]] in that skill.

In addition, choose two types of terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. You have Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks about the chosen terrains, and you have Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures in them.

Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can meditate and replace one of the chosen terrain types with a different one from the list.

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See the _Player's Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Ranger.

***Spell Slots.*** The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

***Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level.*** You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two 1st-level spells from the [Ranger spell list](/onednd/spell_list/ranger). Rather than choosing, you may start with _[[[spell:Cure Wounds]]]_ and _[[[spell:Ensnaring Strike]]]_.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Ranger spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 5th-level Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Ranger spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class.

### 1st Level: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [Mastery](/onednd/general/equipment#mastery-properties) property of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Longswords.

Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]], you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the Mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

### 2nd Level: Favored Enemy

You are adept at focusing on a single foe. You always have the _[[[spell:Hunter's Mark]]]_ spell prepared. You can cast it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### 2nd Level: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess. You gain one of the following Fighting Style feats of your choice: [Archery](/onednd/advancement/Feats#fighting-style-archery), [Defense](/onednd/advancement/Feats#fighting-style-defense), [Dueling](/onednd/advancement/Feats#fighting-style-dueling), or [Two-Weapon Fighting](/onednd/advancement/Feats#fighting-style-two-weapon-fighting).

### 3rd Level: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice, listed at the end of this class description.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Ranger level and lower.

### 4th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 5th Level: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [[glossary:Attack]] action on your turn.

### 6th Level: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy Armor.

You also have a [[glossary:Climb Speed]] and a [[glossary:Swim Speed]] equal to your Speed.

### 7th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Ranger subclass.

### 8th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 9th Level: Conjure Barrage

Channeling nature's might, you can cause your weapon to multiply and strike at creatures before you; you always have the _[[[spell:Conjure Barrage]]]_ spell prepared.

### 9th Level: Deft Explorer Improvement

Choose one of your proficiencies in a skill that appears on the Ranger skill list. You gain [[glossary:Expertise]] in that skill.

In addition, choose two more terrain types for your Deft Explorer feature.

### 10th Level: Tireless

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits:

**Temporary Hit Points.** As an action, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].
**Decrease Exhaustion.** Whenever you finish a [[glossary:Short Rest]], your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.

### 11th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Ranger subclass.

### 12th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 14th Level: Nature's Veil

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself from view. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the [[glossary:Invisible]] condition until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].

### 15th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Ranger subclass.

### 16th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 17th Level: Conjure Volley

Propelled by primal spirits, your weapon can strike a group of targets far away; you always have the _[[[spell:Conjure Volley]]]_ spell prepared.

### 18th Level: Feral Senses

Your connection to the forces of nature grants you [[glossary:Blindsight]] with a range of 30 feet.

### 19th Level: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### 20th Level: Foe Slayer

You become an unparalleled hunter of your foes. When your attack roll misses the target of your _[[[spell:Hunter's Mark]]]_, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll, potentially turning it into a hit.

In addition, whenever you hit that target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage.
