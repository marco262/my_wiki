# Alyse

> **Alyse U. Divlatsia** was born to a Drow and a Half-Woodelf. Born in the temple of Lolth in the Underdark. There were rumors that her mother was extorting people, and parents left to flee (this is Alyse's perception). She was shuffled off to dad's half-woodelf family in the underdark. At some point, **Eilistraee** appeared to her and seduced her from the shadows. By chasing the apparition, Alyse was led to meet with a nearby eclectic group of people who, as it turns out, works for Eilistraee to help free drow. She went with them, worked with them. She made friends with **Liriwyn Silverstrings**, a halfling bard in the group and learned how to be a bard. But her powers are of starlight and moonlight, and her college of creation powers are strange and novel. Plus she's a drow bard, which is practically unheard of. At 12, she is the first cleric of Eilistraee (mechanically bard), out to save as many people as possible and spread the message C: Seeing what she was capable of, her bard mentor hooked her up with this school.

# Meli

> **Meli Solwynn** was born to a minor noble family along with her twin brother, **Rael**. Unfortunately, twins are considered a bad omen in elven society, and the second-born twin is considered a curse on the True Child who was born first. Bearing out this truth, her mother died in childbirth, and Meli was considered the cause. Though she and her brother have a decent enough relationship, both is jealous of the other. For Meli was swept up by an elven princess, **Aelwyn Treesong**, who wanted her for her own playmate. Before she was sent to live with the princess, her father, **Lord Altharion Solwynn**, gave her the family's heirloom sword in a show of love and apology for not being a better father to her -- as she reminded him too keenly of his dead wife. 
> 
> Unfortunately, Meli displaced another playmate of the princess, who had been raised explicitly to be the princess's companion. Meli has thus made a frienemy.
> 
> Meli continued to train in weapons, the one area where her father had really encouraged her -- and also encouraged by the royals, so she can protect the princess. Over time, she realizes that her purpose is to protect the princess, and when she trances, rather than having memories, she began to have premonitions -- all surrounding the princess. When one vision looks like it might end in the princess's injury, she finally told an adult, who shut her down and ignored her. Unfortunately, that ended with the princess being thrown from a horse and sent into a coma. 
> 
> Meli's family, seeing that there's something important about her connection with the royal family, decides to invest in her power and skill and sends her off to the school to train and get to the bottom of her powers.

# Gren

> As far as **Gren Barleybranch** is concerned, the halflings who raised her are her actual parents. She was raised in **Hill-in-the-Hole**, a rural halfling village in the bowl of a dormant volcano. Her upbringing involved practically the whole village. Her parents' home was shabby but loved, modest, and feeling smaller by the day as the 11-year-old kept growing. Everyone knew Gren as the outlier of the village, and everybody loved her, doted on her, and cared for her. She had tons of friends, and cared for animals. The other things she cared for were spirits. She could see nature and animal spirits everywhere she went while she was growing up, and she befriended them and cared for them. One night recently, she was called to another plane by Eldath Himself to undergo an awakening. She manifested her druid powers the next morning by turning into a shaggy donkey in her own room. She'd always loved stories of heroes, but now she gets to be one! She is the sole druid her village has ever heard of, and so they know she needs to spread her big ol' wings elsewhere and learn to be exceptional. So her whole village pooled their resources together to pay for her tuition to this school for the precocious.

# Timtom

> **Timothy Tomothy "Timtom" Timbers the Tenth** was born to a loving home of mother and father, and was a cheerful and frightfully intelligent little boy. His penchant for magic hit early, and he soon became a handful to his beleaguered parents. His father one day vanished without a trace, and his mother, left frazzled in the lurch, got to the end of her rope. She took him to the school for precocious heroes, and Headmaster David saw his potential and took him in despite him being far too young to attend. He was raised by Elleewick and Headmaster David, and trained in the ways of magic.
> 
> As he got old enough to be able to travel alone, he went home to ask his mother for more information about his father. Things got heated, and he accidentally threatened her with his magic. He was run out of town by the neighbors, and he fled to hide in the forest for the remaining days of his trip before he had to go home. While in the forest, he found an ancient temple to a god long forgotten, where he sheltered. In the morning, a shaft of light woke him, and in that light, the god Sarl Silversmith appeared to him, and took him under his wing. 
> 
> As the first gnomish cleric, and the first cleric of light, when Timtom returned home, Headmaster David ran him through several training sessions. And now, as Timtom finally comes of age, he is joining the school properly to learn more about deepening his connection to his god.

> Good morning, students. I am Headmaster David, and it is my great pleasure to welcome you all to Professor David's School for Precocious Heroes.
> 
> As you stand here today, you are about to embark on an incredible journey -- a journey that will shape you, challenge you, and help you discover the true extent of your extraordinary abilities. Each of you has a unique gift, a spark that marks you as a future hero. Whether your powers are magical, physical, or something else entirely, they are what brought you to this special place.
> 
> Look around you. These faces will become your friends, your allies, and perhaps even your rivals. But remember, we are all here with a common goal: to learn, to grow, and to become the best versions of ourselves. In the years ahead, you will face trials that will test your courage, your intellect, and your heart. But fear not, for you are not alone. You have each other, and you have the dedicated faculty and staff who are here to guide you every step of the way.
> 
> Our school motto is "Ex Potentia Fortitudo," which translates to "From power, bravery." This embodies the essence of our mission here. We believe that true heroes are not just defined by their powers, but by how they use them. Your abilities are a gift, but it is your character, your decisions, and your actions that will define you as a hero.
> 
> At this school, we value bravery, kindness, and integrity. As you learn to harness your abilities, you will also learn the importance of responsibility and compassion. You will be taught not only how to control your powers but also when to use them, and more importantly, when not to.
> 
> Your journey here will be filled with hard work, but also with moments of joy and discovery. You will explore ancient tomes in our vast library, master your skills in the training halls, and perhaps even uncover secrets hidden within the very walls of this historic institution. Each lesson, each challenge, each triumph will bring you closer to understanding who you are and what you are capable of achieving.
> 
> You have been chosen to be here because you have the potential to be great. You are the future protectors, the ones who will stand up when others cannot. Always remember that a hero's path is never easy, but it is always worth it.

> 
> Thank you.
