The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]] by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]]. This potion's rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
