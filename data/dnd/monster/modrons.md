Modrons are beings of absolute law that adhere to a hive-like hierarchy. They inhabit the plane of Mechanus and tend its eternally revolving gears, their existence a clockwork routine of perfect order.

***Absolute Law and Order.*** Under the direction of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in the multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the comprehension ofÂ·mortal minds. Their own minds are networked in a hierarchical pyramid, in which each modron receives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego.

Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet they always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no "I", but only "we" or "us."

***Absolute Hierarchy.*** Modrons communicate only with their own rank and the ranks immediately above and below them. Modrons more than one rank away are either too advanced or too simple to understand.

***Cogs of the Great Machine.*** If a modron is destroyed, its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining the physical form of its new rank. The promoted modron is replaced by one of its underlings in the same manner, all the way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a new modron is created by Primus, with a steady stream of monodrones leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on Mechanus as a result.

***The Great Modron March.*** When the gears of Mechanus complete seventeen cycles once every 289 years, Primus sends a vast army of modrons across the Outer Planes, ostensibly on a reconnaissance mission. The march is long and dangerous, and only a small number of modrons returns to Mechanus.

## Monodrone

A monodrone can perform one simple task at a time and can relay a single message of up to forty-eight words.

## Duodrone

The blocky duodrones supervise units of monodrones and can perform up to two tasks at a time.

## Tridrone

Tridrones are shaped like inverted pyramids. They lead lesser modrons in battle.

## Quadrone

Astute combatants, quadrones serve as artillery and field officers in the regiments of modron armies.

## Pentadrone

Pentadrones oversee Mechanus's worker populace and can improvise in response to new situations.

<div class="phb-sidebar" markdown="1">

A modron unit sometimes becomes defective, either through natural decay or exposure to chaotic forces. Rogue modrons don't act in accordance with Primus's wishes and directives, breaking laws, disobeying orders, and even engaging in violence. Other modrons hunt down such rogues.

A rogue modron loses the Axiomatic Mind trait and can have any alignment other than lawful neutral. Otherwise, it has the same statistics as a regular mod ron of its rank.
