*The Viera may begin as part of the Wood, but it is not the only end that we may choose.*

*&mdash; Fran, Sky Pirate*

The viera are a beautiful and mysterious folk, shrouded in mystery as many spend most of their lives in the Woodlands they call home. Their tall, slender bodies are adorned with rabbit-like traits, and true to their likeness, they are a graceful people.

### Separate Paths
Male and female viera rarely interact. Outside of necessary meetings to keep their race continuing onwards and relinquishing the male children who have reached adulthood, they lead separate lives. 

The males of the viera live secretive, lonely lives in which they shun everyone, even their own kin, to fully pursue their sacred role as a Wood-warder. The Wood-warders patrol the outer wilderness of their homes to ensure no outsiders make it through. That isn't to say the women are defenseless though, as the female viera are as fierce and capable as the men, but as a whole, they turn their attention to defending their young and their homes.

### People of the Wood
The word viera itself means "people of the wood" and true to their name, the two clans live in different forests of Dalmasca. Both the Rava and the Veena boast tall, lithe frames and the graceful gaits of rabbits. The Rava make their home in the Golmore Jungle and grew to have umber skin and dark hair, allowing them to more easily blend in with the forest. In stark contrast, the Veena have very light skin and fair hair help them blend in with the Skatay Range they call home.

### Of Jungles and Forests
Both the Rava and Veena clans make their homes exclusively in the Golmore Jungle, or the primeval forests which line the southwestern foothills of the Skatay Range, respectively. Both locations are large, sprawling canopies of forest which provide them with all the viera need to survive. In addition to the thick forest canopy, the Skatay Range boasts white mountains which the Veena have grown to use as a secondary home. Both the Rava and Veena guard their homes violently against trespassers. Anyone who enters their forest homes may be privy to a hostile reception.

### The Green Word
The viera's set of laws are considered to be the laws of the forest in which they live. The viera take jobs under this set of laws and restrict themselves from having contact with the world outside of their forest. 

Along with the many other restrictions they are subject to, some viera will eventually, undoubtedly, find their ways off putting. If a viera chooses to leave the forest, they are considered an outsider from that day forward. These strict laws and stark segregation often drive more individualistic viera away to seek adventure.

### Viera Names
Viera adopt new names at different stages of their life. When a viera is born, their male or female characteristics are not yet present, and so they are typically given names culturally appropriate for any sex and gender. Once they reach adulthood, many adopt a new name. These are called "Forest Names."

Likewise, when striking out from their homes and going into the world, an adventuring viera will also adopt new "City Names" to mark their parting from the traditional viera way of life. These names are often inspired by the names of other races they encounter, or simply things that they like, such as "Cherry" or "Morning Glory." 

Though in many cases viera will stick to names traditionally associated with their gender, there are myriad examples of viera who eschew these patterns by keeping or choosing names considered non-binary or associated with a different gender.

**Forest Names.** Ruuj, Shara, Rena, Rael, Bjonse, Arjm, Coeli, Ysera, Yurhee, Venase, Ukina, Sonja, Slejsa, Qestra, Petra

**City Names.** Fran, Cherry, Morning Glory, Rahan, Rowan, Yehu, Lilipo
