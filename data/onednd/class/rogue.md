**Class Group:** Expert  
**Primary Ability:** Dexterity

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them broad capabilities that few other characters can match. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

When it comes to combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. A Rogue would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.

Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

### Multiclassing and the Rogue

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Rogue as one of your Classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Rogue's primary ability, Dexterity, to take a level in this Class or to take a level in another Class if you are already a Rogue.

***Proficiencies.*** If Rogue isn't your initial Class, here are the Proficiencies you gain when you take your first Rogue level: Thieves' Tools and one Skill of your choice from the Rogue's Skill list.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Rogue level, you gain Light Armor Training.

## Rogue Class Features

As a Rogue, you gain the following Class Features when you reach the specified levels in this Class. These features are listed on the Rogue table.

### 1st Level: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your Skill Proficiencies of your choice. 

Sleight of Hand and Stealth are iconic choices for a Rogue if you have Proficiency in them. 

### 1st Level: Sneak Attack

You know how to turn a subtle attack into a deadly one. Once on each of your turns when you take the Attack Action, you can deal extra damage to one creature you hit with an Attack Roll if you're attacking with a Finesse Weapon or a Ranged Weapon and if at least one of the following requirements is met: 

**Advantage.** You have Advantage on the Attack Roll. 
**Ally Adjacent to Target.** At least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally isn't Incapacitated, and you don't have Disadvantage on the Attack Roll.

To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to half your Rogue level (round up), and add the dice together (the Rogue table shows the number of Sneak Attack dice you get at each Rogue level). The extra damage's type is the same as the weapon's Damage Type. 

### 1st Level: Thieves' Cant

You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves' Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the Standard Languages and Rare Languages tables.

### 2nd Level: Cunning Action

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following Actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Disengage, or Hide. 

### 3rd Level: Rogue Subclass

You gain the [Thief](/onednd/subclass/Thief) Subclass or another Rogue Subclass of your choice. The Thief is detailed after the Rogue's Class description, and other Subclasses will appear in future _Unearthed Arcana_ articles.

A Subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your Subclass's features that are of your Rogue level and lower. This Class's description tells you the levels when your Subclass provides features. 

### 4th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 5th Level: Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an Attack Roll, you can use your Reaction to halve the attack's damage against you (round down). 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Rogue Subclass. 

### 7th Level: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your Skill Proficiencies of your choice. 

### 8th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 9th Level: Evasion

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity Saving Throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the Saving Throw and only half damage if you fail. You can't use this feature if you're Incapacitated. 

### 10th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 10th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Rogue Subclass. 

### 11th Level: Reliable Talent

You have refined your talents until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an Ability Check that uses one of your Skill or Tool Proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. 

### 12th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 13th Level: Subtle Strikes

When you attack, you know how to exploit a target's distraction. You have Advantage on any Attack Roll that targets a creature that is within 5 feet of at least one of your allies who isn't Incapacitated. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Rogue Subclass. 

### 15th Level: Slippery Mind

Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain Proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma Saving Throws. 

### 16th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 17th Level: Elusive

You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No Attack Roll has Advantage against you while you aren't Incapacitated. 

### 18th Level: Stroke of Luck

You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a d20 Test, you can turn the roll into a 20. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short Rest or a Long Rest. 

### 19th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 20th Level: Epic Boon

You gain the Epic Boon of Undetectability Feat or another Epic Boon Feat of your choice.
