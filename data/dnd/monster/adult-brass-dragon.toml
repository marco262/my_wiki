***Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}.*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

**Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a {@dc 18} Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 ({@damage 13d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
**Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or fall {@condition unconscious} for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
