## Notes

* The players need to find the Dread Pirate Lord's first mate, who is hiding on the Dread Pirate Lord's HQ island.
    * She's a half-elf, so she has not aged as much as everyone else. Maybe a cleric so she can create food and shelter for herself?
    * Crippled/cursed, and cannot travel with the party
* Players need to search for the first mate but have no idea where she is:
    * Need ideas on where to find her (need informants, guides)
    * Need access to the islands for either exploration or just getting to the first mate
* The players' options for getting to the island are: 
    * Buy/steal a boat: Easiest but dangerous. The waters beyond the shoreline are not safe, because of pirates, wildlife, and weather.
    * Buy/steal a ship: Much safer but much more difficult. Will need to overpower a whole crew, and then manage the ship themselves.
    * Swim/fly: Dangerous (see Buying a Boat) and tiring. But doable, especially if Rek carries Azurhel.
* Each of the lieutenants has magical gear that is secretly cursed, so that the Dread Pirate Lord can shut them down if they try to turn on him. Give these items to the players.
* Dread Pirate HQ has been taken over by the Knights of Twilight and is strictly off-limits to anyone. 
    * Knights of Twilight are trying to pop open a vault that was recently uncovered, which contains powerful treasure that the Dread Pirate is trying to lead the players to.

### Ways to Get Money

* Working (lol)
* Stealing
* Goblin ears
* Caravan guards
* Running cons with Azurhel

### Costs

* [Vessels](/dnd/general/equipment#mounts-and-vehicles)
* Ship's passage:
    * To islands: 1 sp per mile
    * Outside the map: (depends on general map distances, probably 50gp)
    * Hazard pay: 5x to 10x cost

## TODO

* Figure out what their hook for money is
* Get visual aid images for 
    * Rough Water 
    * Pirates
    * Lord's Landing
    * Uh.... other towns
* Create a grab bag of NPCs, at least 5
* Design at least one island plus the HQ island
* Figure out what the Dread Pirate Lord can provide, other than quests
* Have the Dread Pirate Lord drop hints to a great treasure hidden in the depths of his HQ
* Add distance legend to the world map
* Make Knights of Twilight part of the forces of the local kingdom
* Come up with stories of the Dread Pirate Lord when he was a youngin that he can use or advice or parables
