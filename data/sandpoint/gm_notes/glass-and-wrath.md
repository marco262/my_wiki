# So the Heroes Fucked Up. Now What?

[[accordion Pour One Out for All Our Prep Lost...]]

## As The Glassworks Burns

As the heroes make their way back into Sandpoint, they will see smoke in the distance. As they get closer, they will hear shouting coming from the town. When they arrive, they'll see people running out of their homes and towards the Glassworks. The town guard is too busy running towards the fire to calm people down.

When they arrive at the Glassworks, they'll find it's burning ([1](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning1.jpg), [2](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning2.jpg), [3](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning3.jpg), [4](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning4.jpg), [5](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning5.jpg)). People are gathering around, most staring in horror and shock. Some are sobbing and screaming. They can see some NPCs running into the less-on-fire parts of the building. **Roll Initiative.**

Should the PCs run in, they'll find that different rooms are various levels of on fire ([1](^curse_of_strahd/burning_room.jpg), [2](^curse_of_strahd/burning_room2.jpg)). The glassworking room (A17), loading room (A16), and the preparation room (A15) are engulfed in flame. Going into these rooms immediately results in 6d6 fire damage when a PC enters the room or at the end of his turn. The hallways are painfully hot (2d6 fire damage) and choked with smoke to the point where it's impossible to see in them (heavily obscured) and if a PC doesn't hold their breath, they take a level of Exhaustion every round. All other rooms are filled with smoke, where it's painful to breathe (DC 15 Con Save or take a level of Exhaustion). Any PC that takes a level of Exhaustion is racked with coughing fits for the next hour.

If the PCs don't act quickly, progressive rooms will catch on fire, starting with the file room (A14). At initiative count 20 on every turn, roll 1d4 for each room adjacent to a room that's on fire. On a 1, that room catches on fire. If that room shares an open door or window with the room that's on fire, it's choked with smoke and painfully hot.

## The Panicked Crowd

Outside the building, the friends and families of the different workers are the most distraught.

* William: [Regina](^sandpoint/crying_woman1.jpg) (wife), 3 children
* Wilbur: [Loreni](^sandpoint/crying_woman2.jpg) (wife)
* Wilson: [Brine](^sandpoint/crying_woman3.jpg) (wife), 2 children
* Willow: [Gabriel](^sandpoint/crying_man1.jpg) (husband), 1 child, elderly mother
* Willifred: 
* Wilford: 
* Willoughby:
* Bill: 

Depending on what the party does, they will either be accosted for help, or for an explanation of what happened. If the party admits any responsibility for the fire, they will have a very angry crowd on their hands. Words like "rabid" and "jackal" will be thrown around: terms used to describe adventurers that have attack civilized people.

In that case, the yelling of the crowd gets louder, and the party can see the town guards struggling to try to calm people down. But they will be interrupted by a shrill whistle from [Aldern Foxglove](^sandpoint/aldern_foxglove.jpg). He will speak up on behalf of the party, giving an impassioned speech about the party's past heroic deeds, and for the townsfolk to see to their friends and loved ones, and put their trust in the town guard.

Aldern's pleas will silence the angriest of the mob, and let the more reasonable voices take over. The party will be escorted away by one particular guardsman, [Hanah Pirani](^sandpoint/hanah_pirani.jpg), and taken to the sheriff's office to be questioned. She isn't accusatory or intimidating to the party, but rather appeals to their sense of righteousness and justice. She's astute (DC 15 passive Insight), and catches onto any but the best lies, but doesn't press the party. If the party shares any especially difficult news, then Hanah says she'll need to bring in the mayor and get her to take charge. In the end, she lets them go if they promise to talk to Sheriff Hemlock when he returns.

## The Aftermath

As the heroes make their way back into Sandpoint, they will see smoke in the distance. As they get closer, they will hear more crowd noise coming from the town than is normal. When they arrive, they'll see people are milling about and in a state of distress, some running about with pails of water. The players will be approached by various townsfolk, and it will be hard to hear what they're saying, but the players should get the gist that a fire has happened and people have been hurt.

Should the players wish to check out the Glassworks, they'll find it completely engulfed in flame ([1](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning1.jpg), [2](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning2.jpg), [3](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning3.jpg), [4](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning4.jpg), [5](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning5.jpg)). The heat from the fire makes it impossible to even approach the building, let alone head inside. People are going around with water buckets, mostly tossing water onto nearby houses, soaking the thatch to help prevent the fire from spreading. The House of Blue Stones has caught, but was put out and is being regularly soaked by a bucket line going up to its roof, including [Sabyl Sorn](^sandpoint/sabyl_sorn.jpg). 

Unless they show up MUCH later, at which point it will be just the smoldering remains.

* Willifred: 
* Wilford: 
* Willoughby:
* Bill:

Should the party head to the Sheriff's office first (or anywhere else heading in that vague direction), they'll come across a crowd around the Sheriff's office, demanding an explanation or a reassurance from the authorities. The inexperienced deputies are looking overwhelmed, and will naturally turn to the adventurers for help. If the party admits any responsibility for the fire, they will have a very angry crowd on their hands. Words like "rabid" and "jackal" will be thrown around: terms used to describe adventurers that have attack civilized people.

In that case, the yelling of the crowd gets louder, and the party can see the town guards struggling to try to calm people down. But they will be interrupted by a shrill whistle from [Aldern Foxglove](^sandpoint/aldern_foxglove.jpg).

In the end, she lets them go if they promise to talk to Sheriff Hemlock when he returns.

## Tsuto and the Goblins

The back door of the glassworks is wide open, and although the area immediately around the building has been disturbed by the crowds and fire, and covered with ash and dirt, a simple Survival check will find goblin and humanoid footprints in the sand of the beach just down the slope. The tracks stick close to the short, dirt cliffs, heading east along the shore. An excellent Survival check will recognize that Tsuto's footprints are deeper in the sand than what you'd expect for someone his size, as if he was carrying something heavy.

About a mile along the beach, the ocean encroaches against the shore to the point where the beach disappears. Tsuto waded out into the water and then turned inland, following a stream for a ways before continuing their journey, making sure to cover their tracks. Further tracking won't be useful to find them.
