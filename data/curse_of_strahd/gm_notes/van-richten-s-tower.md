## The Front Door

If anyone touches the front door before the trap is disabled, they trigger the lightning trap. Any creature outside the tower and within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, with disadvantage if it is wearing armor made of metal, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. As long as the effect persists, any creature that enters the lightning for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage. The lightning lasts for 10 minutes.

Ezmerelda triggered the trap when she first arrived at the tower, was injured, and thus has left it alone.

The players must first speak Khazan's name, which will cause the runes (actually letters) above the door to glow. Then, they must perform the movements on the door in order (following the line either way). Each stick figure will light up as the movement is performed. Once the "dance" is done, the whole copper disc flashes once, all the glowing shit fades, and the door unlocks.

If the arm positions are done out of order, a [young blue dragon](^curse_of_strahd/young_blue_dragon.jpg) ([stats](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#young%20blue%20dragon_mm)) magically appears within 30 feet of the door and attacks all creatures it can see. The characters can keep trying to open the door while the dragon is attacking them. The dragon disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the characters open the door.

History checks can help you recognize the name Khazan
