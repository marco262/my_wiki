On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked {@condition prone}, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls {@condition prone} in the bulette's space.
