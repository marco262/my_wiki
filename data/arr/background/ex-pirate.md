## Ex-Pirate
You sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.

During your stay at sea, you spent a lot of time among other less-than-savory pirates and though you've cleaned up your act, you still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of La Noscea. Though you do your best to make a simple, honest living with your new life, sometimes your old life comes calling.

* **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Stealth
* **Tool Proficiencies:** Navigator's tools, vehicles (water)
* **Equipment:** A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table), a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.

### Feature: Bad Reputation
Though in recent years, you've striven to live under the Admiral's Code, in your past life, you indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

### Suggested Characteristics
Ex-pirates might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. Life aboard a ship shaped their outlook, and life on land can fit as snug as a glove or as ill as a knife in the back.
