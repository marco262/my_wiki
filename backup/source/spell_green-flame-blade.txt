description: 'As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell''s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack''s normal effects, and green fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.'
