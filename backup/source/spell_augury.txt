description: "By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. \n\n**The DM chooses from the following possible omens:**\n\n* Weal, for good results\n* Woe, for bad results\n* Weal and woe, for both good and bad results\n* Nothing, for results that arenâ€™t especially good or bad\n\nThe spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret."
