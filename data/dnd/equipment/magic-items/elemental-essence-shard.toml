description = """
This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it. Roll a d4 and consult the Elemental Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

Elemental Essence Shards

d4 Property 1 Air. You can immediately fly up to 60 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. 2 Earth. You gain resistance to a damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn. 3 Fire.

Each creature of your choice that you can see in that area takes 2d6 cold damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and fall prone.
