## Story

When Rek arrives at the [warehouse](^pirates/warehouse_interior_3.jpg), [Quizno](^pirates/quizno_bubblypots.png) will be having a meeting with a [duergar gang](^pirates/duergar_4.png) inside the warehouse, with his goblin henchmen hanging around and acting all menacing. It's an unfriendly meeting, as the duergar are angry that Quizno underpaid them the advance for their delivery. Hands are on weapons, and it's not looking good.

The goblins are on edge, the duergar guards are on edge, the [duergar boss](^pirates/duergar_3.png) is unhappy... and Quizno is calm. He manages to get talked into paying a higher price for the delivery. The duergar are appeased and head off, feeling like they pulled one over on the goblins. The goblins plan once the duergar are gone to just kill the duergar once they arrive with the delivery.

The meeting that night will happen in the [street in front of the warehouse](^pirates/warehouse_exterior_1.jpg), with weapons bristling and tensions high. Extra goblin thugs will be waiting hidden behind crates and in windows to ambush the duergar.

## Quick Notes

* The delivery is fine wine, bon bons, and Binge.
  * Binge is a drug that makes a person immune to pain. 
  * For 1 minute after taking it, they have the Relentless Endurance feature: They ignore the effects of going to 0 HP.
  * Every "hit" of Binge counts as an extra use of the feature.
  * While high, they have an insatiable appetite. Binge-users often will eat the bodies of the people they kill mid-fight.
  * After they come down, if they're still at negative hit points, they die.
* The delivery is intended for Gula, the Pirate Lieutenant. 
  * Searching the warehouse will reveal notes from Quizno that one of the pirate lieutenant's crew will come get the shipment.
  * The notes say it's for The Grand Gourmand.
  * The DPL will recognize this name and peg it as Gula.
* Play around with the battleground.
  * Rek should be able to fly in the warehouse. 
  * Give environmental hazards for people to mess with and cover for Salvia.
* What is the warehouse being used for? What can be looted?
  * What can be burned down?

## Aftermath

* Have Xanner be ready to haul all the stuff away after they're done killing
* His followup job is, if they make it to Pleasure Island, to get in touch with <NPC> and get the money he owes Xanner (500gp).
* If they try to buy passage at the docks, they'll find the [Knights of Twilight](^pirates/knight_of_twilight.png) ([theme]($load|music|pirates/'Fantasy for Brass Band Op. 114' - Sir Malcolm Arnold.mp3)) have locked down the harbor.
  * They're pissed that someone killed Quizno, because they were keeping an eye on him to try to figure out which lieutenant he was selling to, and what he was selling.
* They'll be approached by [Yendan Snazzyfeet](^pirates/yendan_snazzyfeet.jpg), to provide passage for an exorbitant price, or a promise of favors and such.
* He'll ferry them across the waters, managing to bribe a harbormaster to categorize him as "essential traffic".
* Once they're within sight of Pleasure Island, Yendan will turn on the players.
