## NPC notes

Brendaniel:

 * Nascent Wild Magic Sorcerer
 * Starting to learn Prestidigitation and Mage Hand
 * Will learn Catapult

## Expenses

These are things to take out of the party funds when I remember:

+100gp from Grinda Garloth

## Available Plot Hooks

* Go talk to Halgraek Barrelshoulder to get troll skull
  * He wants either 500 gp or help with sabotaging his neighbor who has a nicer house than him
  * Halgraek is willing to rent out the trollskull for 10 gp/day
  * Halgraek is willing to take Gemma Arterton on as a maid as a trial run
* Harpers Mission, "Welcome to the Family"
* Tomassin asks after Emir, clearly smitten
  * Tomassin is spying on the City Watch for Emir (goings on of the Black Network, etc)
* Looking for a mentor for Brendaniel. Ulkoria will find a Draconic Sorcerer to tutor Brendaniel

---

* Uncle David will threaten Emir when he's coming back with the treasure if he doesn't take the treasure back to his family
  * He wishes to confront Golorr itself, for... reasons?

## TODO

* Florence Ableton has two 14 and 16 year old boys
* Soundboard:
  * Add volume control
* Add Nelson laugh to soundboard
* Finish researching Stone of Golorr
* Determine what the three keys are
