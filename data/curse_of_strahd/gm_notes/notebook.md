## Party

[Strahd Squad!](^curse_of_strahd/Strahd_Squad.png)

### Ethel

* Armor Class: 14
* Passive Per: 15
* Passive Ins: 15

Cursed with Lycanthropy

* Around the night of the full moon, Charisma save every 2 hours to resist the Beast inside them.
  * 2 days before (DC 5), 1 day before (DC 10), Night of the full moon (DC 15), 1 day after (DC 10), 2 days after (DC 15)
  * If they fail, they transform into their hybrid form and go on a rampage.
  * While transformed, they can continue to make the save every 2 hours, transforming back on a success.
  * If they choose not to resist the curse, they transform completely and cannot make saves for the rest of the night.
  * Indulging in killing/wanton destruction throughout the night can keep the Beast at bay.

### Orin

* Armor Class: 14
* Passive Per: 11
* Passive Ins: 15

Notes

* All food he eats now tastes like hot borscht (cursed Spoon item from Dragomir)

### Marblepaw

## Journal

* 23: Arrived in the Village of Barovia
* 24: Went to the church
* 25: Buried Kolyan, got a horse, watched a guy die, fixed a guy's hemorrhoids, stopped at the Blue Water Inn in Vallaki
* 26: Left Vallaki, got to Krezk, saw dead people, met Abbot, met Ezmerelda, spent night at abbey
* 27: Went to Wizards of Winery, fought off druids, invaded Yester Hill, took druid to Vallaki, met baron, got bridal gown, got message from Lord Jared
* 28: Uncursed Ethel, delivered baby present, talked to Jared and Sergei, did Tarokka reading (Today)

## General Notes

* Figure out freaky way Orin is connected to Barovia that explains his Phantom Rogueness.
* Strahd may be willing to let Ireena consecrate the remaining Fanes, in return for her promising herself to him.
* Van Richten is absolutely convinced that Strahd is evil and perfectly manipulating people. He will try to convince Ireena that the only way to end Strahd for good is through the Bride Ceremony.
* The Abbot will try to kidnap and keep Ireena if he finds out she's the Bride.
* Have Ireena show reservations towards being courted by Strahd.
* Make the players like Strahd.
* When Ireena kills herself to kill Strahd, he is severely weakened but not killed outright. The players will have to decide whether they want to help him or kill him.
