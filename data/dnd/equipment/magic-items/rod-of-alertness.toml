description = "<p>This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.</p><p><strong>Alertness.</strong> While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.</p><p><strong>Spells.</strong> While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <em>_[[[spell:detect evil and good]]]_</em>, <em>_[[[spell:detect magic]]]_</em>, <em>_[[[spell:detect poison and disease]]]_</em>, or <em>_[[[spell:see invisibility]]]_</em>.</p><p><strong>Protective Aura.</strong> As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any [[[general:conditions#invisible|invisible]]] hostile creature that is also in the bright light.</p><p>The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>"
