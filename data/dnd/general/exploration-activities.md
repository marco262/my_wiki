While you're traveling and exploring, tell the GM what you'd generally like to do along the way. If you do nothing more than make steady progress toward your goal, you move at a [Normal Pace](/dnd/general/Adventuring#travel-pace).

When you want to do something other than simply travel, you describe what you are attempting to do. It isn't necessary to go into extreme detail, such as "Using my dagger, I nudge the door, so I can check for devious traps." Instead, "I'm searching the area for hazards" is sufficient. The GM finds the best exploration activity to match your description and describes the effects of that activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast you can travel and be effective.

Below are the most common exploration activities, but the DM may provide additional options according to the situation, like climbing or swimming or pushing a heavy block down a hallway.

## Avoid Notice
 
You move stealthily to attempt to avoid notice while traveling at half speed. If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, there's a chance the enemy will be Surprised.

## Defend

You move at half your travel speed, ready to defend from attacks. If combat breaks out, you gain the benefits the [Dodge](/dnd/general/Combat#dodge) action on your first turn.

## Detect Magic
 
You cast [detect magic](/dnd/spell/Detect Magic) as a ritual, refreshing the spell as needed as you go. You move at half your travel speed or slower. You have no chance of accidentally overlooking a magic aura at a travel speed up to 300 feet per minute, but must be traveling no more than 150 feet per minute to detect magic auras before the party moves into them.

## Follow the Expert
 
Choose an ally attempting a recurring skill check while exploring, such as climbing, or performing a different exploration tactic that requires a skill check (like Avoiding Notice). The ally must be at least an expert in that skill and must be willing to provide assistance. While Following the Expert, you match their tactic or attempt similar skill checks. Thanks to your ally's assistance, you can roll those checks with Proficiency if the ally has Proficiency in that check, or with Expertise if your ally has Expertise.

## Hustle

You strain yourself to move at double your travel speed. You can Hustle only for a number of minutes equal to your Constitution modifier Ã— 10 (minimum 10 minutes). If you are in a group that is Hustling, use the lowest Constitution modifier among everyone to determine how fast the group can Hustle together. This is different from traveling at a [Fast Pace](/dnd/general/Adventuring#travel-pace), which you can do indefinitely.

## Repeat a Spell
 
You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half speed. Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in a single turn. In order to prevent fatigue due to repeated casting, you'll likely use this activity only when something out of the ordinary occurs.

You can also use this to cast ritual spells, though you must concentrate on the spell the entire time you are using this activity.

## Scout
 
You scout ahead and behind the group to watch danger, moving at half speed. You get advantage on your Perception check to detect any hidden creatures or ambushes. The DM will adjust your passive Perception score to account for this.

## Search
 
You search meticulously for hidden doors, concealed hazards, and so on. You can usually make an educated guess as to which locations are best to check and move at half speed, but if you want to be thorough and guarantee you checked everything, you need to travel at a Speed of no more than 300 feet per minute, or 150 feet per minute to ensure you check everything before you walk into it. You can always move more slowly while Searching to cover the area more thoroughly. If you come across a secret door, item, or hazard while Searching, the GM will use your passive Investigation score to see if you notice the hidden object or hazard. In locations with many objects to search, you have to stop and spend significantly longer to search thoroughly.
