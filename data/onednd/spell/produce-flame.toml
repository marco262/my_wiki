While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as a Bonus Action or if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage."""
