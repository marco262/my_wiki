The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things.

Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

## Necromancy Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved.

## Grim Harvest

By 2nd level, you can produce an artifical life force to temporarily sustain a creature.

As a bonus action, you touch a creature, invigorating its life force. The creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 3 times your wizard level. A dying creature is stabilized while it has these temporary hit points. This feature has no effect on constructs.

Once you invigorate a creature in this way, you must finish a short or long rest before you can produce this effect again.

## Corpse Magic

At 6th level, you add the *[[[spell:speak with dead]]]* spell to your spellbook. This spell is considered a wizard spell for you and can be cast as a ritual. 

In addition, whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has these additional benefits:

* The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.
* The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.

## Inured to Undeath

Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.

## Command Undead

Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this feature again.

Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.
