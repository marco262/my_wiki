*Prerequisite: Intelligence or Wisdom score of 13 or higher.*

Aetherologists are scholars in the field of magic, otherwise known as aether. It is the essence of existence and the very lifeblood of our star, so it is a demanding task, one of constant diligence to safeguard a delicate ecosystem.

* **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Investigation
* **Languages:** Two of your choice
* **Tool Proficiencies:** Aetherologists’ tools
* **Equipment:** A set of travelers’ clothes or fine clothes, a set of aetherologists’ tools, a pouch containing elemental crystals, a book containing your notes, and a purse containing 1,000 gil

## Feature: Preternatural Forensics

You know how to further use aetherologists’ tools to read the ambient aether around you, yielding additional, imperceivable information. Making an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check with an aetherometer will allow you to reliably predict, in an area, who or what may have been present, the events that may have occurred, how recently it may have been, and any consequential effects.

You know that the information you glean with an aetherometer is not conclusive proof of a matter, only supplementary to physical evidence at best.

## Suggested Characteristics

Aetherology is perhaps the most vast and diverse field of study on Hydaelyn, so many of them are simply regular people with a curiosity to view our Star, quite literally, through a different lens. They understand the importance of their work well, but some become rather narcissistic and haughty.

|| 5 || Aetherology is not "just pulling a nutkin out of a hat!" ||

||~ d6 ||~ Ideal ||
|| 1 || **Life.** All I think about is using my knowledge to help people, or better yet, help all of Etheirys. (Good) ||
|| 2 || **Duty.** Aether is our star's very lifeblood, I and others like me made an oath to safeguard it. (Lawful) ||
|| 3 || **Greed.** Services such as mine are in high demand and because of that, they're far from free. (Evil) ||
|| 4 || **Knowledge.** There's always more to learn, and the more I learn the better off I will be. (Any) ||
|| 5 || **Work.** Watching aether is mesmerizing and it happens to pay well. That's why I went into this field. (Neutral) ||

## Variant Aetherologist: Chirurgeon

If you decide that your background in aetherology specializes in medicine and healing, you may choose the Chirurgeon feature below instead of the Preternatural Forensics feature.

## Variant Feature: Aetheric Ministrations

With this alternate feature, the proficiency of Investigation is replaced with Medicine.

You instead use your aetherometer for use within the medical field, properly being able to diagnose and treat aether sickness and other magical illnesses. Additionally, you know how to create remedies for these ailments using crystals as ingredients in place of traditional medicine.
