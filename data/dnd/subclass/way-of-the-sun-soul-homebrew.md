Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.

## Radiant Sun Bolt

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**What changed?** Added the ability to use Radiant Sun Bolt any time an unarmed strike could be used, like with your  free Martial Arts bonus action attack, and increased its range to match walking speed.

</div>

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, any time you would make an unarmed strike, you can instead attack with a searing bolt of magical radiance. A Radiant Sun Bolt is identical to an unarmed strike, except it is a ranged attack with a range equal to your speed that does radiant damage.

## Searing Arc Strike

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**What changed?** Changed damage type to radiant, allowed the range of the attack to increase, and added a blind effect to add a pseudo-support aspect to the ability.

</div>

At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into bright waves of energy.

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 ki points as a bonus action to produce a blinding flash of light in a 15 ft cone in front of you. Each creature within the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 radiant damage and is [[[general:conditions#blinded|blinded]]] until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not [[[general:conditions#blinded|blinded]]] on a successful one.

You can spend additional ki points to make a stronger blast. Each additional ki point you spend increases the damage by 1d6 and range by 5 ft. The maximum number of ki points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.

## Searing Sunburst

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**What changed?** Allowed the area of the AoE to increase.

</div>

At 11th level, you gain the ability to create an orb of light that erupts into a devastating explosion. As an action, you magically create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts into a sphere of radiant light for a brief but deadly instant.

Each creature in that 20-foot-radius sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage. A creature doesn't need to make the save if the creature is behind total cover that is opaque.

You can increase the sphere's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, up to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by 2d6 and the radius of the sphere by 5 ft.

## Radiant Body

<div class="errata" markdown="1">

**What changed?** Complete re-write to give a more Super Saiyan flavor.

</div>

At 17th level, as a bonus action, you can enter a state of heightened being known as Radiant Body, fusing your physical form with the raw power of your radiant soul. While in Radiant Body, you gain the following benefits:

* You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
* You gain a flying speed equal to your speed.
* Whenever you hit with a melee weapon attack or Radiant Sun Bolt, you do additional radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + 1.
* All ki costs are reduced by one, to a minimum of 1.
* You are immune to the effects of exhaustion.

While in this state, you must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of your turns, with a DC of 12. If you succeed on the saving throw, the DC increases by 1. If you fail the saving throw, you suffer 1 level of [exhaustion](/dnd/general/conditions#exhaustion). If you already have 6 levels of exhaustion and fail the saving throw, Radiant Body ends and you die.

You can end Radiant Body as an action. Radiant Body also automatically ends if you are [[[general:conditions#incapacitated|incapacitated]]]. After you finish a long rest, the DC of the Constitution saving throw resets to 12.
