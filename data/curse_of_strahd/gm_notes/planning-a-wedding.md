After the PCs leave the Amber Temple, they'll stop by Yaedrag where they'll have a meetup with Elder Ormir, Helwa, etc. Good things happen, they'll probably share what they've learned with Elder Ormir.

When the PC leave Yaedrag, they get to decide what they do next. If there's enough waffling about, Van Richten will cast Sending to tell them to meet him at his tower.

# Van Richten's Debriefing

When the PCs talk to Van Richten, they'll give him a summary of their dinner with Strahd. Van Richten will be attentive, encouraging as many small, seemingly insignificant details out of them as he can. His final demeanor will not be cheered, but deeply thoughtful, staying silent for many long moments after he's out of questions. Their summary of the Amber Temple will get even deeper thought, with even more probing questions. He'll stop them in the middle of their explanation, go get a notebook, and take thorough notes.

If asked, Van Richten will give them his own thoughts and predictions: He believes that Strahd is leading them on, faking vulnerability to get in their good graces. However, he is becoming slowly more convinced that Strahd's interest in Ireena is genuine, but his final goal for her is unclear. He's uncertain that Strahd would want to turn her into a consort, because turning a creature into a vampire destroys their soul and makes them a shell of their former self. This doesn't sit right with Van Richten, as everything he's learned about Strahd tells him that the vampire wants Ireena n√©e Tatyana to be his; body, mind, *and* soul. 

Clearly, more investigation is needed. He will encourage Ireena to continue her courtship with Strahd, to hopefully suss out Strahd's true intentions.

# More Stuff

* Party meets with Strahd
* Ireena is convinced to be courted
  * Figure out courting
* Strahd eventually brings up he wants to do the Bride Ceremony
* Ireena has to think about it
* Ireena has 1v1 meetings with all PCs, Esmeralda, and Van Richten

# The Courtship

Ireena will insist they Do Things Properly, and go through a whole Courtship with Strahd. Play along with this, encourage the PCs to get involved with planning. Use *Can You Feel The Love Tonight* or *Bella Noche* as background music at some point.

If Ireena shares with Strahd that she talked to Vampyr, he will at first be furious. But after some thought, he will be excited, as it means he has some extra reason to think the Bride Ceremony will work. 

Eventually, Strahd will propose to Ireena, who will need time to think about it.

## The Bride Ceremony

The Bride Ceremony is a method that Strahd has devised to share his Dark Gift with someone else. It requires a magical ritual where he fills a goblet with his blood, and Ireena must drink it. After she's drunk it, she will take on the same powers as Strahd, including his immortal, vampiric nature.

# Van Richten's Revelation

After the PCs notify Van Richten of the Bride Ceremony...

Van Richten's theory is that, because Strahd has made his pact with a Dark Power, it means that the source of his strength can also be a weakness. Dark Powers are the antithesis to all things good, beautiful, and pure. But that means that those things are also the antithesis to the Dark Powers. And in a moment of revelation, Van Richten will reveal his theory that Strahd is trying to kill two birds with one stone: To get Ireena into his unlife, but also loosen the Dark Powers' hold on him with one weapon they can't defend against: Love. (If Marsha starts to come up with this idea, lean into it.)

He will then tell them about the Bride Ceremony, an ancient ritual he only knew through legend where a Vampire can make another Vampire without destroying the previous one's soul. He thinks this is what Strahd's final goal is, and he encourages the PCs and Ireena to go through with it. Ireena will falter, but Van Richten will push the hardest on convincing the PCs to follow through with this idea, knowing they will convince Ireena.

## Van Richten's Master Plan

After this, let the PCs plot and plan amongst each other. Meanwhile, Van Richten will take Ireena aside for cleric training. During this time he will tell her that he thinks the Love Conquers All plan is doomed to failure. BUT he lets her know that the Bride Ceremony briefly bonds the vampire with their victim so tightly, that if the victim dies, the vampire itself will likely die as well. So he convinces her that, after the Ceremony is complete, she should stab herself with a hidden knife and use her Divine Eminence on her newly-undead body, killing her self and hopefully killing Strahd. 

Ireena will be horrified but agree, as Van Richten leans hard into the "You're the only one who can save this land" guilt-tripping. She will not tell the PCs, and pretend she's nervous about the plan to marry Strahd.

# The Ceremony

The [ceremony](https://old.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8a2b91/usefuloptional_fluff_collated_by_me/) will be held in Castle Ravenloft's chapel (be open to players insisting it happen elsewhere). Lean into wedding symbology, with Rahadin officiating. It will end with "You may now bite the bride," and Strahd biting Ireena, who will gasp in pleasure. Then Strahd will bite open his wrist and give Ireena his blood. She'll drink hungrily, both of them clearly getting a lot of sexual pleasure from it, moaning and pressing together.

Strahd will pull Ireena away, and laugh triumphantly as she recovers, staggering in place. He'll turn to the chapel and cheer his victory. "She is mine! Her body, her soul, her heart, her mind... We are as one! I can sense every--" His smile will fall, and he'll look back at Ireena, stunned as she pulls out a knife from her dress, looks Strahd in the eyes, and plunges it into her heart. She screams in pain as she channels her Divine Eminence into her body, and Strahd doubles over, screaming in return pain. The party can see her hands, the knife, and her chest glowing with sunlight.

Everyone is stunned as they watch this happen, and as suddenly the light fades. Ireena and Strahd stare at each other, her gaze distant and broken. And then she falls before him, first to her knees, before dissipating into dust before she hits the floor.

Strahd will be kneeling on the ground, clutching his chest. He tries to speak, but just coughs up dark blood, as black as ichor. He staggers to his feet, clearly severely injured. But then he'll turn his gaze full of fury at the party and scream, "KILL THEM!"

Roll initiative! The party must decide if they wish to kill Strahd while he's weakened, while every one of his minions will be charging in to try and attack the party. Strahd will be at half-health with no Heart of Sorrow shield, and only able to attack with disadvantage. If the party does not try to kill Strahd, try to kill them first (a TPK right now would be satisfying). If they get away, Strahd will hunt them relentlessly. He won't be swayed, and he can't be stopped.

Notes:

* Figure out what happens to Van Richten and Ezmerelda during all of this. If they can appear to defend the PCs in the middle of the battle, all the better.
* Ireena agrees to the wedding
  * Why? Work out better details
* Bunch of fetch quests for ceremony
  * Figure out fetch quests
* Ireena is along for some of them, and they remind her that Barovia is a prison, and Strahd is the jailer
  * She goes to meet Ismark, the village is morose as fuck, bad stuff has happened (pies?)
* Ireena decides it is her *duty* to free the people of Barovia by killing Strahd
