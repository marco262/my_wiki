# Barry's Introduction
Start on the [Airship](^arr/Airship.bmp) with the bachelor party, flying toward [The Gold Saucer](^arr/Gold%20Saucer%20exterior.jpg): 
- The groom, ["Bill"](^arr/Image%20-%20Roger.jpg)
- Younger loser ["Zack"](^arr/Image%20-%20Abram.jpg)
- Amused chaos rarity ["Jack"]((^arr/Image%20-%20Noah.jpg))
- Flirty Flirter ["John"](^arr/Image%20-%20Emmet.jpg)
- Best man ["Richard"](^arr/Image%20-%20Nero%20Tol%20Scaeva.jpg) -- I mean, ["Richard" (with a Hat)](^arr/Image%20-%20Nero Tol Scaeva with Hat.jpg)
- ...and finally Barry, the young tagalong

Brush briefly over the people in the party
All of them are wearing some sort of Disguise Self item that Nero made for them to hide their third eye.
They're joking around together, poking fun at Rogerius's nickname for this Eorzean excursion, "Bill." 
They also talk about how risky it is to be in Eorzea like this -- maybe they should do this with their soldiers, infiltrating them in with small parties like this. 
Touch on how excited they are to brave the savage wasteland of civilization. The Golden Saucer is supposed to be as fancy as a palace, to the Eorzeans.

Then focus on Nero, who has a little scene with Barry that ties into his backstory and his family.

# The Gold Saucer
**Music:**  [FFXIV OST Gold Saucer Theme]($load|music|arr/FFXIV OST Gold Saucer Theme.mp3)
Disembark in the Gold Saucer, and describe the wonders of the casino:

```ad-desc
The Gold Saucer â€” a place for all to indulge in transient dreams. The long, gold-carpeted hallway from the airship disembarking platform leads to a grand area lit largely by backlit stained glass and subtle spotlights. In the center of the room is a huge recreation of the Gold Saucer building itself, including giant Cactuar. Surrounding it is an enormous circular counter staffed by [[Gold Saucer - Attendants.jpg|attendants in playboy bunny outfits]].

More attendants strut around, offering handouts of fliers, maps, flutes of champagne, and what appears to be coins. 
```

One, a pink-haired lalafell approaches your party with a bright smile.

> Welcome to the Gold Saucer's first ever Rising Festival! Would you care for some champagne?

The party gathers their bounty from the attendant, and Nero snags two champagne flutes for Barry. He drags him in close and tells him to have fun, get snockered, and let loose a little. Then the bachelor party leaves Barry alone to wander.

```ad-desc
This is the massive aetheryte plaza that is the navigational hub for the casino. You've never seen anything like it before outside of books: a massive cluster of glowing blue crystal towers above you to thrilling heights. Eorzeans wink in and out of sight as they travel through the aetherite network. Something that you, of course, are incapable of.

Short halls lead off from here in four directions:
- [[Gold Saucer - Mount Corel.jpg|To the North]] lies what appears to be an indoor mountain, with Eorzeans clambering up to the top in an obstacle course. The map marks this as "Mount Corel" in the "Round Square." (What an odd name.)
- [[gold saucer event square.jpg|To the East]] lies a huge circular stage with a podium atop it, and milling crowds checking out the food stalls. This is the "Event Square."
- [[Gold Saucer - Wonder Square.jpg|To the South]] is a huge, sparkling ramp of rainbow hue, surrounding Senor Sabotender, the Gold Saucer cactuar mascot. At the base of the ramp is the game "Lord of Verminion," according to your map. At the top of the ramp you can just make out a dining platform that stretches all the way around the outside of the room. This is "Wonder Square."
- Finally, [[Gold Saucer - Entrance Square.jpg|to the West]], is "Entrance Square," which holds helpful attendants, the prize counter, and the entrance into the Games of Chance arena, as well as the exit back to the airship.
```

# Godbert's Welcoming Speech
After everyone has arrived, and started to mingle, there's an announcement to come to Event Square to hear opening ceremonies. 

```ad-desc
Behind the podium stands a white-haired-and-bearded hyur who is majestic to behold. Though he wears a snappy white suit top with black trim, you can tell his body is sculpted with muscle. His eyes are hidden behind small, round, red spectacles, and his forehead bears the laddered markings of a monk. But his grin is anything but monkish: he is THRILLED to be here as he surveys the gathering crowd.
```

[[Image - Godbert Manderville.png|Godbert]] lets the crowd settle down, then takes on a more serious, contemplative mien as he starts his speech.

> One year ago today, Eorzea experienced a terrible tragedy at the Battle of Carteneau. In a mighty clash against the dastardly Garlean Empire, the greater moon Dalamud was pulled from the sky and cracked like an egg to reveal the great Primal Bahamut.
> Countless warriors fought in the battle and fell. Even my own darling son, Hildy... *(chokes up)*
> Today, we gather to remember those who fell, those whose faces are like a bright light in our memories. 'But Mr. Manderville,' I hear you say, 'remembrance should be a solemn occasion! This is a festival!' And I hear you, I do! 
> But I say this: our heroes would not have wanted us to muddle about and whimper! No! They would want us to take up arms! To rise again as new heroes! To take up their mantle and continue their fight!
> And so today is the first annual Rising Festival! The theme of the day is *friendship!* Reach out, Eorzeans, and make new connections, for only by standing together can we make the future bright!
> Welcome, and enjoy!

With that, Godbert steps out from the podium, revealing his [[Image - Godbert Manderville (full).png|short shorts]] as he struts confidently off the stage.

The party is free to enjoy the games.
- After the games have been experienced at least once, we can handwave them getting the rest of the MGP they need to get the prizes they want from the prize counter.
