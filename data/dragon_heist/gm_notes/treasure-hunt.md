## Important Notes

* *Ahghairon's dragonward*
  * Ahghairon was Waterdeep's first Open Lord, and his tower still stands in the Southwest corner of the Castle Ward.
  * In the mid-11th century DR, Ranressa Shiard returned as a hero from her journeys to Waterdeep atop the mighty copper dragon Galadaeros. Although she was welcomed home, the appearance of her mount flying over the city unsettled the majority of the populace. Ahghairon lead a ritual to create *Ahghairon's dragonward* to allay their fears.
  * The dragonward is centered on [Ahghairon's tower](^ahghairons_tower.jpg), and encompasses all of Waterdeep, as far as anyone knows.

## Pink Flumph Theater

* *Kiss of a Lamia* was written by Cecil Weiss
* [Yaliek Iltizmar](^yaliek_iltizmar.jpg), plays the evil prince in *Kiss of a Lamia*
* [Iokaste Daliano](^iokaste_daliano.png), middle-aged widow, owner of the Pink Flumph Theater
* [Wishes](^faerie_dragon.jpg), [faerie dragon](/dnd/monster/faerie dragon), protects the theater

When exploring the theater, mention the mirrors used to reflect sunlight and torchlight onto the stage.

## Vault Key

A bronze dragon scale, stamped with the private symbol of Dagult Neverember, reflecting sunlight onto the door.

### Bronze Dragon Scale

[Zelifarn](^zelifarn.jpg), a [young bronze dragon](/dnd/monster/bronze dragon#young-bronze-dragon) living in Deepwater Harbor, looking for treasure.

 * Seen by many sailors and dockworkers
 * Lurking inside a shipwreck 120 feet underwater
 * Still searching for treasure, will try to scare players away. Only fights in self-defense.
 * DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) or 1,000 gp in treasure will convince him to give up one of his scales.
   * If he hears about the treasure, demands 10% of the take

### Private symbol of Dagult Neverember

 * Renaer goes on the hunt for his father's private symbol. 
 * He finds that his father's vacation home in the Sea Ward has been robbed. However, all the stolen loot is in bags still by the door.
 * Renaer does no more exploring, and contacts the party.
 * The study's door has been forced open, despite the very sturdy lock.
 * Robber's corpse is on the ground with a letter opener in his chest.

When the players step in, they have enough to take in the room, and then they notice things start to move. The objects around them slowly come to life and attack them. They need to find the mechanism to shut it off.

Animated objects (stats per *[animate objects](/dnd/spell/animate objects)* spell):

 * Suit of armor with bastard sword (medium)
   * When it comes apart, it starts to grapple person who killed it, trying to trap them in the suit
 * Table (medium)
 * 2x Chair (small)
 * Letter opener (tiny)
 * Tea set (4x tiny)
 * Books (tiny)

Items on the shelf/ground:

 * [Hourglass](^Hourglass.jpg), sand flows in reverse
 * [Engraved pen](^engraved_pen.jpg) from his wife
 * [Broken wand](^broken_wand.jpg)
   * From his apprenticeship
 * [Medal](^gold_medal.jpg) given to him during his inauguration as Open Lord
   * In the hand of the robber
 * [Toy soldier](^toy_soldier.jpg)
   * On the ground
   * Renaer's childhood toy, who's surprised his dad kept it
   * Holding the toy sword, if the sword is put in its scabbard the defenses are disabled

### Putting the Key Together

Embric and Avi working together can get the seal put onto the scale, but it will be grueling work and they'll need to work together. Embric to get the fires hot enough, and Avi to do the delicate embossing. However, in the middle of it all, one of Avi's tools will break and he'll need a replacement from the Metalmasters' Hall in the Southern Ward. It will take an hour roundtrip to get the tool, but Embric can only keep the heat up for another 30 minutes.

### Sunlight

The players will have to figure this one out, lol. Twenty steel mirrors at 5gp apiece could work

A noble family (whichever they approach) can loan them a Driftglobe. Renaer probably has one just sitting around. Any other noble house will request some kind of favor.

## Vault of the Dragons 

### Emir's Eleven

* Emir D'Amour
* Tom Nielson Alley
* Guy Buddie
* [Grinda Garloth](^grinda_garloth.jpg) ([stats](/dragon_heist/gm_notes/Grinda Garloth)) and her [Crab](^crab_defender.jpg)
* [Renaer Neverember](^renaer_neverember.jpg) ([stats](/dnd/monster/Noble))
* [Brendaniel](^brendaniel_skwik.jpg) ([stats](brendaniel sqwik))
* [Wishes](^faerie_dragon.jpg) the [faerie dragon](/dnd/monster/faerie dragon)

### Images

* [Underground temple](^underground_temple.jpg)
* [Black Pudding](^black_pudding.jpg) ([wiki](/dnd/monster/black pudding))
* [Barok Clanghammer](^barok_clanghammer.jpg)
* Aurinax [1](^gold_dragon.jpg), [2](^gold_dragon_2.jpg)

### Vault Door

An [underground tunnel](^underground_tunnel.jpg) leads to the vault.

[The vault door](^Vault-Door.jpg) is covered with Dwarvish writing, which can be deciphered to say, "Welcome all those who will give thanks and praise to our gods. Enter ye who will hold respect and wonder in thine hearts."

### Aurinax

Aurinax the [gold dragon](/dnd/monster/adult-gold-dragon) will be absent when they first arrive, but then appear in his dwarven form, hobbling on the staff. He'll greet them with a friendly smile, and ask their names, happy to have someone to talk to. But when they talk about taking the treasure, he'll get concerned. He agreed to only let Dagult Neverember or his appointed vassals take the treasure. He is VERY good at spotting lies, so Deception checks are tough to pull off. 

However, if the party convinces him (DC 18 Persuasion) that they wish to return the treasure to the city, he's willing to part with it if they pass a test: Fight him in single battle. If they survive, they can leave with the treasure. In reality, he just wishes to ascertain they really are devoted to a selfless act.

### Treasure Hoard

The [treasure pile](^treasure_pile.png) takes up one of the alcoves in the vault, and it is comprised of:

* 95,746 copper pieces
* 144,111 silver pieces
* 479,376 gold pieces
* 4,735 10gp gems

Total value: 542,094.56 gp
Total 'coins': 723,968
Total weight: 14479.36 pounds (29 bags of holding)
Total volume: 100,254.58 in^3

The pile is about 6 feet tall and about 6 feet wide.

The most money from the pile that can be fit in a bag of holding is 4,735 gems and 20,265 gold pieces for a total value of 67,615 gp.

### Ambush

While leaving the vault, they will be confronted by [Nar'l Xibrindas](^nar'l_xibrindas.jpg) a [drow mage](/dnd/monster/drow-mage) with his [Grell](^grell.jpg) ([wiki](/dnd/monster/grell)) bodyguard and six [bugbears](^bugbear.jpg) ([wiki](/dnd/monster/bugbear)). ([Shadow Demon](^https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/images/shadow-demon.jpg))

### Encounter with David

Once they've defeated the Xanathar forces (or when they're about to be defeated), all of the NPCs around them will freeze in place. [Uncle David](^uncle_david.jpg) will step out from behind a pillar and congratulate the PCs on their success. He will praise Emir, and greet Tom and Guy, apologizing for his discretion and not greeting them sooner. Eventually, he will change to [Lord Jared](^lord_jared.jpg), the look Tom and Guy are most familiar with, but very extra.

He will explain that he owed a favor to Emir's father, and that favor was called in to help Emir on his quest. But Jared isn't in this just for philanthropy, he has other angles as well. In particular, he wants the [Stone of Golorr](^stone_of_golorr.jpg). Or rather, Golorr itself.

When he mentions the stone, it will attempt to coerce Emir into refusing to let Jared have the stone (DC 20 Charisma saving through). Jared will attempt to convince Emir even through the charm that it's in his best interest. If that fails, Jared will request help from Guy and Tom (dealing damage to Emir, or creative pleas will let him repeat the saving throw). 

### Fight with Golorr

Once Jared has the stone, he will explain to the PCs that he needs to purge the creature in the stone, but it will fight back and he needs the player's help to subdue it. When they are ready, [Golorr](/dnd/monster/aboleth) the [aboleth](^aboleth.png) will appear in a nearby space, and will attempt to attack David and the party. 

Golorr will target most of its attacks at David, who will shrug them off but otherwise be unable to respond. After a round or two, Golorr will attempt to enslave the most dangerous PC. When it succeeds, the next round Jared will expel the charm from the PC, creating a shadow version of that PC. The PCs must then contend with the shadow version and Golorr. If Golorr is defeated, any remaining shadow PCs disappear, and Jared sucks up the wounded Golorr into a glass sphere with water inside and a tiny version of the aboleth within. He then thanks the party with a smile, and... TBC
