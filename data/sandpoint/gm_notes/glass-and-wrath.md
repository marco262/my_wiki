# So the Heroes Fucked Up. Now What?

[[accordion Pour One Out for All Our Prep Lost...]]

## As The Glassworks Burns

As the heroes make their way back into Sandpoint, they will see smoke in the distance. As they get closer, they will hear shouting coming from the town. When they arrive, they'll see people running out of their homes and towards the Glassworks. The town guard is too busy running towards the fire to calm people down.

When they arrive at the Glassworks, they'll find it's burning ([1](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning1.jpg), [2](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning2.jpg), [3](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning3.jpg), [4](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning4.jpg), [5](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning5.jpg)). People are gathering around, most staring in horror and shock. Some are sobbing and screaming. They can see some NPCs running into the less-on-fire parts of the building. **Roll Initiative.**

Should the PCs run in, they'll find that different rooms are various levels of on fire ([1](^curse_of_strahd/burning_room.jpg), [2](^curse_of_strahd/burning_room2.jpg)). The glassworking room (A17), loading room (A16), and the preparation room (A15) are engulfed in flame. Going into these rooms immediately results in 6d6 fire damage when a PC enters the room or at the end of his turn. The hallways are painfully hot (2d6 fire damage) and choked with smoke to the point where it's impossible to see in them (heavily obscured) and if a PC doesn't hold their breath, they take a level of Exhaustion every round. All other rooms are filled with smoke, where it's painful to breathe (DC 15 Con Save or take a level of Exhaustion). Any PC that takes a level of Exhaustion is racked with coughing fits for the next hour.

If the PCs don't act quickly, progressive rooms will catch on fire, starting with the file room (A14). At initiative count 20 on every turn, roll 1d4 for each room adjacent to a room that's on fire. On a 1, that room catches on fire. If that room shares an open door or window with the room that's on fire, it's choked with smoke and painfully hot.

## The Panicked Crowd

Outside the building, the friends and families of the different workers are the most distraught.

* William: [Regina](^sandpoint/crying_woman1.jpg) (wife), 3 children
* Wilbur: [Loreni](^sandpoint/crying_woman2.jpg) (wife)
* Wilson: [Brine](^sandpoint/crying_woman3.jpg) (wife), 2 children
* Willow: [Gabriel](^sandpoint/crying_man1.jpg) (husband), 1 child, elderly mother
* Willifred: 
* Wilford: 
* Willoughby:
* Bill: 

Depending on what the party does, they will either be accosted for help, or for an explanation of what happened. If the party admits any responsibility for the fire, they will have a very angry crowd on their hands. Words like "rabid" and "jackal" will be thrown around: terms used to describe adventurers that have attack civilized people.

In that case, the yelling of the crowd gets louder, and the party can see the town guards struggling to try to calm people down. But they will be interrupted by a shrill whistle from [Aldern Foxglove](^sandpoint/aldern_foxglove.jpg). He will speak up on behalf of the party, giving an impassioned speech about the party's past heroic deeds, and for the townsfolk to see to their friends and loved ones, and put their trust in the town guard.

Aldern's pleas will silence the angriest of the mob, and let the more reasonable voices take over. The party will be escorted away by one particular guardsman, [Hanah Pirani](^sandpoint/hanah_pirani.jpg), and taken to the sheriff's office to be questioned. She isn't accusatory or intimidating to the party, but rather appeals to their sense of righteousness and justice. She's astute (DC 15 passive Insight), and catches onto any but the best lies, but doesn't press the party. If the party shares any especially difficult news, then Hanah says she'll need to bring in the mayor and get her to take charge. In the end, she lets them go if they promise to talk to Sheriff Hemlock when he returns.

[[/accordion]]

## The Aftermath

As the heroes make their way back into Sandpoint, they will see [smoke in the distance](^sandpoint/sandpoint_burning_in_the_distance.jpg). As they get closer, they will hear more crowd noise coming from the town than is normal. When they arrive, they'll see people are milling about and in a state of distress, some running about with pails of water. The players will be approached by various townsfolk, and it will be hard to hear what they're saying, but the players should get the gist that a fire has happened and people have been hurt.

Should the players wish to check out the Glassworks, they'll find it completely engulfed in flame ([1](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning1.jpg), [2](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning2.jpg), [3](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning3.jpg), [4](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning4.jpg), [5](^sandpoint/glassworks_burning5.jpg)). The heat from the fire makes it impossible to even approach the building, let alone head inside. People are going around with water buckets, mostly tossing water onto nearby houses, soaking the thatch to help prevent the fire from spreading. The House of Blue Stones has caught, but was put out and is being regularly soaked by a bucket line going up to its roof, including [Sabyl Sorn](^sandpoint/sabyl_sorn.jpg). 

Unless they show up MUCH later, at which point it will be just the smoldering remains.

## The Panicked Crowd

Outside the building, the friends and families of the different workers are the most distraught.

* William: [Regina](^sandpoint/crying_woman1.jpg) (wife), 3 children
* Wilbur: [Loreni](^sandpoint/crying_woman2.jpg) (wife)
* Wilson: [Brine](^sandpoint/crying_woman3.jpg) (wife), 2 children
* Willow: [Gabriel](^sandpoint/crying_man1.jpg) (husband), 1 child, elderly mother
* Willifred: 
* Wilford: 
* Willoughby:
* Bill:

Should the party head to the Sheriff's office first (or anywhere else heading in that vague direction), they'll come across a crowd around Town Hall, demanding an explanation or a reassurance from the authorities. The inexperienced town guard are looking overwhelmed, and will naturally turn to the adventurers for help. If the party admits any responsibility for the fire, they will have a very angry crowd on their hands. Words like "rabid" and "jackal" will be thrown around: terms used to describe adventurers that have attacked civilized people.

In that case, the yelling of the crowd gets louder, and the party can see the town guards struggling to try to calm people down. But they will be interrupted by a shrill whistle from [Aldern Foxglove](^sandpoint/aldern_foxglove.jpg). He will speak up on behalf of the party, giving an impassioned speech about the party's past heroic deeds, and for the townsfolk to see to their friends and loved ones, and put their trust in the town guard.

Aldern's pleas will silence the angriest of the mob, and let the more reasonable voices take over. The party will be escorted away by one particular guardsman, [Hanah Pirani](^sandpoint/hanah_pirani.jpg), and taken into the sheriff's office to be questioned. She isn't accusatory or intimidating to the party, but rather appeals to their sense of righteousness and justice. She's astute (DC 15 passive Insight), and catches onto any but the best lies, but doesn't press the party. If the party shares any especially difficult news, then Hanah says she'll need to bring in the mayor and get her to take charge. In the end, she lets them go if they promise to talk to Sheriff Hemlock when he returns.

## Tsuto and the Goblins

The back door of the glassworks is wide open, and although the area immediately around the building has been disturbed by the crowds and fire, and covered with ash and dirt, a simple Survival check will find goblin and humanoid footprints in the sand of the beach just down the slope. The tracks stick close to the short, dirt cliffs, heading east along the shore. An excellent Survival check will recognize that Tsuto's footprints are deeper in the sand than what you'd expect for someone his size, as if he was carrying something heavy.

About a mile along the beach, the ocean encroaches against the shore to the point where the beach disappears. Tsuto waded out into the water and then turned inland, following a stream for a ways before continuing their journey, making sure to cover their tracks. Further tracking won't be useful to find them.

## What Does Brodert Quink know?

[Theme]($load|music|arr/FFXIV OST Ascian Theme [Without Shadow].mp3)

1. Thassilon was an ancient empire that existed thousands of years ago, before the rise of the modern nations of Avistan.
2. Thassilon was ruled by powerful wizards known as "runelords," each of whom had dominion over a different aspect of magic and society.
3. Thassilon's runelords were associated with seven virtues and seven sins, and each sin was said to be associated with a different school of magic.
4. Thassilon's magic was highly advanced, and many of its secrets have been lost to time.
5. Thassilon's capital city was known as Xin-Shalast, and it was said to be located somewhere in the mountains of the far north.
6. Thassilon was eventually destroyed by a cataclysmic event known as the Earthfall, which is said to have been caused by the hubris and arrogance of Thassilon's rulers.
7. Brodert theorizes the Old Light was once a war machine capable of spewing fire to a range of more than a mile.

## Goodbye to Aldern

Aldern Foxglove is ready to say a bittersweet farewell to the Heroes. His story is that he must return to his recently reacquired ancestral home to continue renovations. He eagerly invites the Heroes to visit him soon, "after all this nasty business with goblins is taken care of, of course."

Delve into small talk between Aldern and the PCs, and hint at Aldern's internal struggle and his self-hatred. Talk about how he envies the PCs, how he wishes he could be as brave and selfless and honest as them. Turn on the waterworks when you can.

## The Aftermath

Following the week after the Glassworks fire, the party will have to deal with multiple citizens of Sandpoint either coming to them for help or causing problems:

* ~~Bethana will approach the party, begging to hear what's happened with Ameiko, and if they found any trace of her.~~

## Downtime Activities

**Note:** Be sure to roll the dice for "complications" for each activity. Don't worry about the value, but make it look like these complications were randomly rolled, not planned. 

### Rusty: Research

* Malfeshnekor: He will not be able to find any information on Malfeshnekor in any reference material. The higher the roll, the more confident he'll be that this is very arcane knowledge. However, as part of this research, he will dig up the name [Pazuzu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pazuzu): Demon Lord of the Sky and Winged Creatures, and known to be a rival of Lamashtu.
* [Old Light](^sandpoint/the_old_light.jpeg): Perched atop a 120-foot high cliff, the remains of the Old Light rises an additional 50 feet above that. Thought by most to be the ruins of an ancient lighthouse, Brodert has lengthy treatises and calculations and references that he believes "prove" the Old Light is the remains of an ancient weapon. He also believes there are hidden chambers in the rubble underneath the Old Light, but he hasn't been able to convince Sandpoint to supply the manpower to properly excavate it.

### Letter from Aldern

Two nights after Aldern left, he will send a paper bird to the party:

> My Dear Friends,
> 
> I am writing to let you know I have arrived safely at Foxglove Manor. I wish to express my thanks once again for all you've done for not just myself, but the people of Sandpoint and, eventually I'm certain, all of Varisia. I do hope that the next time you are traveling along the Lost Coast Road, you will take time out of your day saving the world to pay my humble self a visit. I would be thrilled to have you, no matter the time or season.
> 
> Your Faithful Friend,
> Aldern Tiberius Foxglove

### Althaea: Work

Alathaea will spend her time working with Aesrick Battlehorn as well as a number of other tradesmen/dockworkers/etc to clear the rubble from the Glassworks. In a week, they will make noticeable progress, but not enough to clear an opening into the basement. During the work, Alathaea will either strike up a conversation with the workers or overhear their conversations. The workers will be complaining about getting into arguments with their husbands and wives, and as the days wear on, news will spread about the Banana inn shutting down and how sad and upsetting that is. 

While working on the stairs going down to the basement, part of the floor will collapse and one of the men will be pinned by the rubble. It will take a concerted effort by all the workers (including Althaea) to get the man free, and it ends with his leg being crushed, and he'll have to be carted off to the temple to be seen by Father Zantus.

Note: When rolling for earned income, make Alathaea's DCs lower than normal due to her work being simple and straightforward. Because the party has free lodging at the Rusty Dragon, use the following table for earned income.

| Check Total | Earnings |
|-------------|----------|
| 7 or lower  | 1 gp     |
| 8-12        | 5 gp     |
| 13-18       | 10 gp    |
| 19+         | 35 gp    |

### Angry Rats

After a few days of work, one evening Ilsoari will ask the party to come down to the Catacombs. They'd been keeping a large cage of rats down there near the pool to do experiments on. And unfortunately when Ilsoari came down that evening to check measurements and do some more experiments, he found a few dead rats in the cage, torn up by their noticeably more-aggressive comrades. The power level of the pool has not noticeably changed.

### Delfi: Gambling

It's easy to find people to gamble with at any tavern in Sandpoint, but the majority of them only host friendly games that barely make any money (below the 10gp minimum for the gambling activity). Though [the Hagfish](^sandpoint/hagfish.jpg) is the place to be if you want to gamble during the day.

If Delfi wants to bet more than that, she will need to ask around covertly, at which point she'll learn the [Fatman's Feedbag](^sandpoint/fatmans_feedbag.jpg) is the place to be for illegal, high-stakes gambling. She'll be initially rebuffed by [Gressel Tenniwar](^sandpoint/gressel_tenniwar.jpg), but [Jubrayl Vhiski](^sandpoint/jubrayl_vhiski.png) will call her over and make his introductions. He'll be charmed by Delfi's homey nature, and invite her to join his table the next night. But he'll warn her that the minimum buy-in is 10gp (or whatever amount she decided she wants to spend).

The next night, Delphie will join a table of multiple intimidating ne'er-do-wells. As the gambling continues on, have Delfi roll Perception checks to catch hints of cheating around the table. She will have to roll VERY high to catch Jubrayl. Eventually, [Yendan Snazzyfeet](^pirates/yendan_snazzyfeet.jpg) will get angry and accuse Jubrayl of cheating. They'll get into an argument, and it will end with Yendan leaping onto the table and lunging at Jubrayl with his rapier. If Delfi wants to join the fight, roll initiative. After a round or two of Yendan failing to hit his target, Jubrayl will get a dagger into Yendan's gut. The room will immediately clear out before the guards arrive, but not before everyone cashes out (and splits Yendan's winnings between the remaining players). Jubrayl playing it cool and asking Delfi to not mention what happened there.

### Alarming News

Give the players a chance to RP Delfi getting back from the inn. After Delfi gets a chance to share her news, a [red-winged blackbird](^sandpoint/redwinged_blackbird.jpg) will arrive with a note tied to its leg. The note is from Ilsoari, telling the party to come to the catacombs immediately, as the power level of the pool has suddenly increased.

When the party arrives, they'll find Ilsoari and Brodert arguing over their notes, but they will inform the party of their findings and work with them to try to determine the simultaneity of events. Brodert has an hourglass and a small pendulum clock on table nearby, where he's taking meticulous notes.

### Lyse: Training (Herbalist's Kit)

0 / 10 weeks

Lyse will be taught by [Hannah Velerin](^sandpoint/hannah_velerin.jpg) at [her herbalist shop](^sandpoint/hannahs.jpg). In the morning, she'll lead Lyse out to the surrounding wilds to gather herbs. In the afternoons, they'll return to her shop and home to prepare medicines and receive patients. During this training, Lyse will be present while she has a checkup with a pregnant woman and her husband, where Hannah will provide the couple herbs to help combat nausea and swollen feet. The wife will be extra frustrated about everything, complaining the whole time.

At one point during the downtime, Lyse and Hannah will return to the shop to find that lye has been dumped all over Hannah's garden, killing the plants. Hannah will break down into tears and will need comforting. She'll share with Lyse that she suspects it's this woman who's been spreading nasty rumors about her, after she slept with the woman's husband.

### Grog: Work

Grog will spend time with [Gorvi](^sandpoint/gorvi.jpg) and his boys, mostly young men and homeless vagabonds who are too rough to hold down more dignified jobs, but can be easily cowed by a big half-orc threatening to "clean da streets wid yer face". Gorvi will be happy to talk about his backstory, mentioning how living in Sandpoint is nicer than the orc tribe he grew up in. If pressed, Gorvi will cheerily talk about how he was treated as a runt by the other orcs, beaten and made fun of. His mother died when he was too young to remember her, but he'd gathered from hearing the other orcs talk about her that she was kidnapped from a human settlement, taken back to the orcs' camp, and gangraped until she was pregnant. This happened a few times, with Gorvi being her youngest child, and his other siblings either died or naturalized with the orcs, and he doesn't really consider them family.

One of the days Grog is working with Gorvi will be "dey pay day", as Gorvi puts it. They'll go around to the Sandpoint homes and "politely" ask for donations for their work. They're already paid a nominal fee by the city itself for their service, but this is just soliciting "tips". Gorvi is more than happy to use a little casual intimidation, not-at-all-subtly implying he might not clean up their junk so well if they don't tip him. Most people will react anywhere from openly annoyed to quietly cowed, but when they get to Rovanky Tannery, [Larz Rovanky](^sandpoint/larz_rovanky.jpg) will openly insult Gorvi and his boys for their extortion. This will provoke Gorvi's boys, and unless Grog intervenes somehow, a fight will break out that could easily lead to a death or two. Town guards will arrive after 2-3 rounds and put a stop to the fighting.

Note: Because the party has free lodging at the Rusty Dragon, use the following table for earned income.

| Check Total | Earnings |
|-------------|----------|
| 9 or lower  | 1 gp     |
| 10-14       | 5 gp     |
| 15-20       | 10 gp    |
| 21+         | 35 gp    |

### A Breakthrough

The night before Hemlock returns from Magnimar, Ilsoari and Brodert will develop a testable hypothesis. They will discover that the pool seems to be storing power, acquiring it from the deaths of any humanoids nearby. And because the pool was made with a purpose, and that purpose was to store power, it is reasonable to assume the pool is also designed to release that power for a purpose and in a controlled way. But the trick is to figure out what way that is.

Hypothetical options to try to release power from the pool:

* Dipping animals in the pool (not effective)
* Animal blood in the pool (not effective)
* Animal sacrifice (not effective)
* Sacrifice of valuable items, like silver or gems (not effective)
* Prayer or cleric spells (not effective)
* Getting really rage/emo near the pool (not effective, but easier to accomplish than normal)
* Dipping humanoids in the pool (costs 3 points, see [description](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/artifacts/minor-artifacts/runewell-minor/))
* Human blood in the pool (costs 6 points, see [description](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/artifacts/minor-artifacts/runewell-minor/)) 

Points in the Runewell: 21

## Return of the Sheriff

Sheriff Hemlock will return 7 days after he left (6 days after the Glassworks fire). He will return with a contingent of soldiers all bearing the [standard of Magnimar](^sandpoint/magnimar_flag.jpg) and [Roland Hart](^sandpoint/roland_hart.jpg), a vice justice under Justice Ironbriar to keep an eye on the regiment of soldiers Sheriff Hemlock brought back.

While at Magnimar, Hemlock was updated by the mayor of the Runewell as well as the emigration of people from Sandpoint. He reached out to contacts for further resources to house those people and, in the worst case, the possibility of handling a mass evacuation of the town. He was met largely with sympathy but no assistance or promises of assistance beyond the guards he was able to bring back to Sandpoint.

### Briefing the Sheriff

Hemlock will learn about the death at the Fatman's Feedbag, and want to question Delfi about it. He'll ask her for her story, and specifics like:

When Hemlock learns about the Runewell, he will trust Ilsoari's take on the situation over anyone else's. He will also say this is "adventurer shit" and ask the party to "take care of it".

If the plan to evacuate the town is brought up, it will meet fierce resistance:

* Hemlock was not able to get any assistance in Magnimar to handle a whole town arriving and needing refuge
* Deverin will be convinced that most people will resist leaving their homes to be raided, especially after the arrival of the soldiers
* Ilsoari specifically will not be willing to leave Turandorak Academy
* Brodert will not want to leave his research and the learning opportunities behind

### Roland Hart

[Roland Hart](^sandpoint/roland_hart.jpg) is a serious man, who highly values professionalism and decorum. However, he is keen on being helpful to the people of Sandpoint. His orders from Justice Ironbriar are to make sure the regiment of soldiers sent from Magnimar are not being abused by Sheriff Hemlock. Secretly, he's also told to keep an eye on signs of moral and legal corruption in the people of Sandpoint.

Roland's accent is Korvosan, and is similar to a Boston accent. His tone sits halfway between his nose and his throat, and he tends to draw out his words, while flattening his pronunciation. He speaks carefully and precisely. His humor is dry, and he tends to finish his jokes with a belated half-smile.

Roland is a Level 3 Bard.
