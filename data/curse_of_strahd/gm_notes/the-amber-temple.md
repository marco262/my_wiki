# Notes

Before going into the Amber Temple, tell the players the following things:

* This is a dungeon, and I will be running it like one.
* This means monsters, random encounters, traps, secret doors, and the like.
* Just because you've previously explored a room does not mean it's guaranteed to be safe when you return.
* Not every room in the dungeon will have something interesting, but exploration *will* be rewarded (if you look in the right places).
* You do not need to fight everything you come across in this dungeon.
* Getting out alive is not guaranteed, nor are you guaranteed to safely take rests here.
* Your choice of whether to bring a light source will be important. Having a light source means it will be easier to see around you, but it may tip off things in the dungeon that you're approaching.
* Reminder: If you have darkvision, you treat complete darkness as dim light. This means that any Perception check related to sight is made at disadvantage. This means that it's easier for things to sneak up on you in darkness, even if you have darkvision.
* What loot you can carry out will be limited by your carrying capacity (15 x Strength score), so take some time to work out the weight of the items you currently have on hand. If you don't know the weight of any of your items, let me know and I'll tell you.

  * The following inscription has been carved into the frame above the front door into the Amber Temple:<br><blockquote style="margin-left: 0;"><p><i>If you seek honor or power, turn back - for these walls hold naught but doom.<br>In amber tombs below, the darkness shelters a timeless evil.<br>This temple is infected with a scourge of malevolent divinity.<br>Our arrogance and folly forged this place into our prison.<br>Leave now, before our damnation becomes yours.</i></p></blockquote>
  * A character with a passive Perception of 15 or greater notices that the snow to the left side of the temple entrance appears to have been traversed recently. A DC 15 Survival check reveals a set of human footprints alongside a much larger pair of canine paw prints leading to Area X1a (Narrow Fissure). A DC 15 Nature check can identify the paw prints as belonging to a winter wolf.

  * <blockquote style="margin-left: 0;"><p>A twenty-foot-wide balcony of black marble with a shattered railing overlooks a vast temple. Black marble staircases at each end of the balcony descend thirty feet to the temple floor. The vaulted ceiling is thirty feet above the balcony. The walls and ceiling are covered in an amber glaze, lending the gloom a golden sheen. A set of amber doors stands closed at the west end of the balcony. A similar pair stands open to the east.</p><p>The balcony railing before you is battered and bent, as if it was struck with great force and bent inwards. Laid across the crooked metal is a corpse, a mix of exposed bone and dried flesh, long ago mummified by the extreme cold of the mountains. Its head hangs back, empty eye sockets staring at you in frozen horror. A dark splotch of long-dried blood has pooled beneath the body, dripping off the edge of the balcony to the darkness beyond.</p><p>Beyond this corpse, you can see the dark shapes of others, strewn about the stairs leading downwards, and all along the dark marble floor below.</p></blockquote>

  * <blockquote style="margin-left: 0;"><p>Four black marble columns support the vaulted ceiling of the temple, at the north end of which stands a forty-foot-tall statue of a cowled figure in flowing robes. The statue's stony hands are outstretched as if in the midst of casting a spell. Its face is a void of utter blackness. The ominous statue stands between two black marble balconies, one of which has partially collapsed and fallen on the temple's black marble floor, in front of an open doorway. The walls of the temple are sheathed in amber, and the doors leading from it are made of amber as well. Arched hallways coated with amber lead away from the temple to the west and east. Flanking these exits are alcoves that hold white marble statues of robed human wizards with pointed hats and golden staffs. One of them has toppled over and lies shattered on the floor.</p><p>Corpses litter the dark marble floor all around you. Limbs and bodies and heads and bones bump against your boots or crunch underfoot, a macabre museum of an ancient battleground. Though despite the death you're surrounded by, the stench of rot is conspicuously absent. The area right in front of the statue is piled up with corpses and bones, as if they were a collection of some monstrous creature.</p></blockquote>
