The typical _crystal ball_, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the _[scrying](/dnd/spell/scrying)_ spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following _crystal ball_ variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the _[detect thoughts](/dnd/spell/detect thoughts)_ spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the _crystal ball_, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this _[detect thoughts](/dnd/spell/detect thoughts)_ to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if _[scrying](/dnd/spell/scrying)_ ends.
