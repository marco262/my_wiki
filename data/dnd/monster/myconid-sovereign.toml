***Distress Spores.*** When the myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

***Multiattack.*** The myconid uses either its Hallucination Spores or its Pacifying Spores, then makes a fist attack.

***Fist.*** {@atk mw} {@hit 3} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}8 ({@damage 3d4 + 1}) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ({@damage 3d4}) poison damage.

***Animating Spores (3/Day).*** The myconid targets one corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet of it and releases spores at the corpse. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant. The corpse stays animated for {@dice 1d4 + 1} weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.

***Hallucination Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. The {@condition poisoned} target is {@condition incapacitated} while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Pacifying Spores.*** The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a {@dc 12} Constitution saving throw or be {@condition stunned} for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Rapport Spores.*** A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
