You have honed your larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically adopt this Subclass, but so do Rogues who prefer to think of themselves as treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators.

In addition to improving your agility and stealthiness, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there. 

### 3rd Level: Fast Hands

You have additional options for the Bonus Action of your Cunning Action, with which you can do the following:

**Search.** Take the Search Action. 
**Sleight of Hand.** Make a Dexterity Check (Sleight of Hand) to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves' Tools or to pick a pocket. 

### 3rd Level: Second-Story Work

You have trained to reach especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits: 

**Climb Speed.** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.
**Jump Distance.** When you take the Jump Action, you can make a Dexterity Check, instead of a Strength Check. 

### 6th Level: Supreme Sneak

You have Advantage on every Dexterity Check (Stealth) you make, provided you aren't wearing Medium or Heavy Armor. 

### 10th Level: Use Magic Device

In your treasure hunting, you have learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits: 

**Attunement.** You can attune to up to four magic items at once. 
**Charges.** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll a d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.
**Scrolls.** You can use any _[Spell Scroll](/dnd/equipment/magic-item/Spell Scroll)_ that bears a cantrip or a 1st-level Spell. You can also try to use any _Spell Scroll_ that contains a higher-level Spell, but you must first succeed on an Intelligence Check (Arcana) with a DC equal to 10 + the Spell's level. On a successful check, you cast the Spell from the scroll, and you use Intelligence as your Spellcasting Ability for this casting. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates. 

### 14th Level: Thief's Reflexes

You can now take a second Bonus Action on your turn, provided it is the Bonus Action from Cunning Action. You can use this feature on a number of turns equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
