Some of the pages below shouldn't have a type tag, as they represent a collection of monsters on one page. In this case, each of the monsters collected there should have individual wiki pages which all redirect to the collection page. e.g. [[[monster:dragons]]], [[[monster:red-dragon]]]

In some cases, the monster page represents a primary monster, with other monster variants listed on that page as well. In this case, the monster page in question should be tagged for the primary monster, while the monster variants link to that page via redirects. e.g. [[[monster:zombie]]]
