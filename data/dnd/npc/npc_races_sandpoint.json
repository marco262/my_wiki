For example, wrathful sinspawn can smell a barbarian who is raging, or just a creature who is predisposed to anger. This ability gives the sinspawn advantage on any Perception checks made to detect that creature by scent."

These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes [poisoned](/dnd/general/conditions#poisoned) for 1 minute. An affected target that is bitten a second time is [staggered](/dnd/general/conditions#staggered) for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. [Calm emotions](/dnd/spell/Calm Emotions), [remove curse](/dnd/spell/Remove Curse), or [greater restoration](/dnd/spell/Greater Restoration) removes this effect."
