Under its merciless Legatus, the XII<sup>th</sup> legion of Garlemald values power above all else, having little use for those who will not "hunt" their own prey. To that end, Castrum Abania was constructed in the peaks above Ala Mhigo, conducting wicked experiments to merge man and magitek in forbidden union. You are one of these experiments. 

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation
- **Languages:** Garlean, and one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of prisoners' clothes, a shiv, a memento of your life prior to becoming an experiment, and a set of identification tags stating 'Number (your choice)'

## Your Prior Circumstances
Choose from the table or roll a d4 to determine why you were experimented upon.

| d4  | Reason                                                 |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I willingly volunteered. This is my duty to Garlemald. |
|  2  | I thought this was an opportunity for a better life.   | 
|  3  | I committed a crime and this was my sentence.          |
|  4  | I was dragged against my will, kicking and screaming.  |

## Feature: Resonant
The Garlean scientist, Aulus mal Asina implanted you with an artificial recreation of The Echo. The procedure has permanently marked one of your eyes as a result - with it emitting an ominous red glow. 

Your "transcendent eye" can detect minor changes in the ambient aether around you, twitching slightly each time an area changes in some way. Even if you do not know why,  you always have an inkling of when danger is about to strike. Commonfolk who see your eye are generally unnerved and may keep their distance.

## Suggested Characteristics
Survivors of merciless experimentation are left with scars - both physical and psychological. Those loyal to Garlemald, however, are likely to embrace the damage wrought upon them as much as the newfound power given to them.

|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I often depart onto a power trip when given authority. |

|  5  | Whenever I see my reflection, I just stare a moment.   |
|  6  | I blow up when insulted about my condition.            |

|  1  | I am blessed not by gods, but by Garlean ingenuity.        |
|  2  | I survived, and I will stand for those who did not.        |
|  3  | I owe my new life to Lord Zenos and Aulus mal Asina.       | 
|  4  | I will kill Zenos and that Asina lackey for what they did. |
|  5  | I formed a bond with the other test subjects.              |
|  6  | I had to leave my old life behind, I will return someday.  |

|  1  | I sometimes suffer from sudden panic attacks.           |
|  2  | I ignore all compliments, I'm just an abomination.      |
|  3  | I find it hard to relax, my heart is always pumping.    | 
|  4  | I feel like I'm always being taken advantage of.        |
|  5  | I cover myself up, my looks are nothing to be proud of. |
|  6  | Now that I'm enhanced, all others are beneath me.       |

## Variant Feature: Hypertuned
Magitek engineers strapped you to the operating table and implanted you with magitek augmentations. Your physical body has been enhanced and become noticeably muscular, but your complexion suffered adversely - now a deep, unnatural gray. 

You feel very little pain, if any at all, and you are wholly unaffected by strenuous activities. Hostile humanoids will often think twice about threatening you or otherwise initiating combat, unless they are confident they can win.

> ## Optional Feature Extension
>To better represent your background feature, mechanical benefits can be applied. Before adding them onto your character sheet, pray return to your Dungeon Master and seek their permission first.
>
>- **Resonant:** You gain one level of **The Echo**, and the *Transcendent Eye* cantrip (see Appendix E).
>
>- **Hypertuned:** Your carry capacity is doubled and your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 Thunder damage. Should you be reduced to 0 hit points during combat, you instead fall unconscious at the end of your next turn. In addition to a Medicine skill check, you can be stabilized through use of an engineers' kit (see Appendix D).
