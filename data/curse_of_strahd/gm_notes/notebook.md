## Party

### Ethel

* Armor Class: 14
* Passive Per: 14
* Passive Ins: 12

Cursed with Lycanthropy

* Around the night of the full moon, Charisma save every 2 hours to resist the Beast inside them.
  * 2 days before (DC 5), 1 day before (DC 10), Night of the full moon (DC 15), 1 day after (DC 10), 2 days after (DC 15)
  * If they fail, they transform into their hybrid form and go on a rampage.
  * While transformed, they can continue to make the save every 2 hours, transforming back on a success.
  * If they choose not to resist the curse, they transform completely and cannot make saves for the rest of the night.
  * Indulging in killing/wanton destruction throughout the night can keep the Beast at bay.
