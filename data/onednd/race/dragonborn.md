**Children of Two Humanoid Races**

Humanoids of different races sometimes have children together. For example, people who have a human parent and an orc or an elf parent are particularly common. Many other combinations are possible.

If you'd like to play the child of such a pairing, choose two Race options that are Humanoid to represent your parents. Then determine which of those Race options provides your game traits: Size, Speed, and special traits. You can then mix and match visual characteristics -- color, ear shape, and the like -- of the two options. For example, if your character has a halfling and a gnome parent, you might choose Halfling for your game traits and then decide that your character has the pointed ears that are characteristic of a gnome.

Finally, determine the average of the two options' Life Span traits to figure out how long your character might live. For example, a child of a halfling and a gnome has an average life span of 288 years.

The ancestors of Dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the worlds of the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story holds that dragons created the Dragonborns' progenitors without the gods' blessings. Whatever their origin, Dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the worlds of the Material Plane.

Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons -- scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned, with horns on their heads. Dragonborn of chromatic ancestry have scales that are black, blue, green, red, or white, whereas Dragonborn of metallic ancestry have scales that are the color of brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver.

Like their draconic ancestors, Dragonborn can exhale acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. One can tell the type of energy a Dragonborn breathes by the color of the Dragonborn's scales.

As a Dragonborn adventurer, you have the following special traits.

***Draconic Ancestry.*** Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestor table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits, as well as the look of your Draconic Flight. The chosen dragon also affects your appearance, with you displaying coloration and other features reminiscent of that dragon.

#### Draconic Ancestor

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |

***Breath Weapon.*** When you take the Attack Action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity Saving Throw against a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach the following character levels: 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have Resistance to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Draconic Flight.*** When you reach 5th level, you learn how to channel the magical energy of your Draconic Ancestry to give yourself temporary flight. As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you are Incapacitated or you retract the wings as a Bonus Action. During that time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your wings appear to be made of the energy used by your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
