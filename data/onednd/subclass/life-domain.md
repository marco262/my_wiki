The Life Domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy -- one of the fundamental forces of the multiverse -- that sustains all life. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that force of life to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is associated with agricultural deities, sun gods, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the powers of this domain.

### 3rd Level: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|       7th       | _[[[spell:Aura of Life]]]_, _[[[spell:Death Ward]]]_                                                |
|       9th       | _[[[spell:Greater Restoration]]]_, _[[[spell:Mass Cure Wounds]]]_                                   | 

### 3rd Level: Disciple of Life

Your healing spells are empowered by life itself. When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot's level.

### 3rd Level: Preserve Life

As part of casting a prepared Abjuration spell from the Divine spell list, you can expend uses of Channel Divinity to create a spell slot to use for the casting. You must expend a number of Channel Divinity uses equal to the spell's level. For example, you can expend one use of Channel Divinity to create a 1st-level spell slot for a casting of _[[[spell:Shield of Faith]]]_ if you have that spell prepared.

### 6th Level: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one creature other than you, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.

### 17th Level: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.
