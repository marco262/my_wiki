### Welcome to the Family

([doppelganger stats](/dnd/monster/doppelganger))

The doppelgangers arrived in Waterdeep three years ago as a group, initially intending to perform marvelous cons in this great city. However, they couldn't come to agreements on how to go about it, which lead to a falling out and the group splintered. They're still friends and meet up every now and then, but they no longer have any plans to perform cons together.

The recent uptick in monster-people causing problems in Waterdeep (mostly XG is to blame for this) has lead to the City Guard cracking down on non-citizens of Waterdeep, and especially monstrosities. Bonnie is worried that her and her friends will be targeted during this investigation.

* [Durnan](^dragon_heist/durnan.jpg)
* [Bonnie](^dragon_heist/bonnie.jpg)
  * Wants to help her group get protection and live normal lives
* [Willifort Crowelle](^dragon_heist/willifort_crowelle.jpg), aging male tiefling (doppelganger) who works as a personal servant for the Cassalanters
  * Too proud to be a "pawn in another's plot"
  * Could be swayed with promises of political favors given to the Cassalanters
    * The Cassalanters' industry is banking and money-lending, with a side-hustle of rumormongering
* [Naneatha Lharilstar](^dragon_heist/naneatha_lharilstar.jpg), beautiful human noblewoman (dopperganger)  
  * Will insist on meeting somewhere other than her estate because she never learned that Nanathea is an old friend of Durnan.
  * Feels that with her new role, she's above having to work for others to please them.
  * Can be swayed if her identity is threatened.
  * History:
      * Originally was a public carriage driver.
      * Took Naneatha's identity after she died in an "accident". Will refuse to give more information.
        * The truth is that the real Naneatha died when her carriage was blown off a cliff in a freak windstorm, and was mortally wounded. The doppelganger finished the fall's work and has taken her identity.
      * Now acts as a courtesan around Piergeiron's Palace, earning many sugar daddies to keep up her luxurious lifestyle. 
* [Cecil Weiss](^dragon_heist/cecil_weiss.png), male human bard (doppelganger) who makes his living as a musician/actor/playwright
  * Investigation/History/Performance DC 15 to recognize Cecil Weiss' name:
    * Up and coming entertainer
    * Rivals and competition have been coming into strange scandals or having "accidents" 
  * Would ask for 500 gp in return for the work, but could be swayed by proper threats to his reputation
* [Vaniel Shortwick](^dragon_heist/vaniel_shortwick.png), female halfling (doppelganger) who mixes drinks at the Hole in the Wall, part of the [Shard Shunners](shard-shunners)
  * Begs the party not to tell Dasher or any of the Shard Shunners
  * Will take the offer if the players use her identity as leverage
