The following options are available to your Eldritch Invocations feature. The options are arranged into sections based on level.

# Level 1

## Agonizing Blast

## Fiendish Vigor

_Prerequisite: None_

You can cast _[[[spell:False Life]]]_ on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the Temporary Hit Points; you automatically get the highest number on the die.

## Pact of the Blade

_Prerequisite: None_

As a Bonus Action, you can trace arcane sigils in the air to conjure a pact weapon in your hand -- a Simple or Martial melee weapon of your choice with which you bond -- or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, you can use its Mastery property, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls, instead of using Strength or Dexterity, and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature's Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

## Pact of the Tome

_Prerequisite: None_

Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a [[glossary:Short Rest]] or [[glossary:Long Rest]]. This Book of Shadows (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the following benefits:

**Cantrips and Rituals.** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.  
**Spell Slot.** You gain a level 1 spell slot. Once you expend it, you can't gain another slot from this feature until you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]].  
**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.

The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

## Gaze of Two Minds

You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don't maintain it in this way.

While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature's space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.
