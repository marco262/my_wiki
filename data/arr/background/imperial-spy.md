## Specialization
Choose from the table, or roll a d4 to determine your preferred strategy of acquiring information.

| d4  | Strategy                                                 |
|:---:|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Dexterity. A careful, covert method of infiltration.     |
|  2  | Intelligence. Skillful deduction minimizes overall risk. |
|  3  | Charisma. I amass the so-called "friends with benefits." | 
|  4  | My party. A motley rabble, but quite resourceful...      |

## Feature: Frumentarius
You are assigned the rank of *eir*, which is officially recognized within Garlemald and Her territories.

You may contact your superiors at the Frumentarium via your magitek transceiver and request any available information on people, places, or objects. Conversely, you may be tasked with gathering information of similar nature. None save the Frumentarium know, or can know, of your true role as a foreign spy, so imperial troops will treat you as they would all Eorzeans - as savages.

## Suggested Characteristics
Propaganda in Garlemald runs rampant with intense hatred for other peoples and places. But after spending time abroad, it is not uncommon for imperial spies to reconsider their zealotry and see others for what they are - equals.

## Variant Imperial Spy: Imperial Fugitive
You became disillusioned with Garlemald and used your mission abroad as an opportunity to disappear. Perhaps you disagreed with particular protocols, or was your view of the empire simply romanticized from the beginning?

If you decide that your spy career involved desertion, you must choose the Renegade Intel feature below instead of the Frumentarius feature.

## Variant Feature: Renegade Intel
As a former spy, you possess knowledge on imperial protocols that others do not. This gives you the unique ability to make reliable estimates about any of their forces you encounter, without requiring a skill check. This may include legion identity, strength of numbers, potential objectives, the layout of fortifications etc.

Those who learn of your fugitive status may grow to mistrust, or even become hostile towards you, at your DM's determination. Desertion is punishable by death, so imperial forces who recognize you will immediately become hostile.
