**Class Group:** Expert  
**Primary Ability:** Dexterity, Wisdom

Far from the bustle of cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch.

Wanderers of the wilderness, Rangers specialize in facing monsters that threaten the world. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast Spells that harness the primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus on the task of protecting the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

## Creating a Ranger

To create a Ranger, consult the following lists, which provide Hit Points, Proficiencies, and Armor Training. If you're making a 1st-level character, also consult the [Starting Equipment](#starting-equipment) section, and if you're using the multiclassing rules, see the [Multiclassing and the Ranger](#multiclassing-and-the-ranger) section.

Then look at the Ranger table to see the Class Features you get at each level in this Class. The descriptions of those features appear in the [Ranger Class Features](#ranger-class-features) section.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d10 per Ranger level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points per Level after 1st:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier  

#### Proficiencies

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity  
**Skills:** Athletics, Stealth, Survival (or choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival)    
**Weapons:** Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons  
**Tools:** None  

#### Armor Training

Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields

### Starting Equipment

As a 1st-level character, you start with the following equipment, or you can forgo it and spend 150 GP on equipment of your choice.

* Arrows (20)
* Explorer's Pack
* Longbow
* Quiver
* Scimitar
* Shortsword
* Studded Leather Armor
* 8 GP

### Multiclassing and the Ranger

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Ranger as one of your Classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Ranger's primary abilities, Dexterity and Wisdom, to take a level in this Class or to take a level in another Class if you are already a Ranger.

***Proficiencies.*** If Ranger isn't your initial Class, here are the Proficiencies you gain when you take your first Ranger level: Martial Weapons and one Skill of your choice from the Ranger's Skill list.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Ranger level, you gain the following Armor Training: Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Shields.

***Spell Slots.*** Add half your Ranger levels (rounded up) to the appropriate levels from other Classes to determine your available Spell Slots for casting Spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare Spells for each of your Classes individually, referring to the Spell Slots of an individual Class to determine the number and levels of the Spells you prepare for it.

## Ranger Class Features

As a Ranger, you gain the following Class Features when you reach the specified levels in this Class. These features are listed on the Ranger table.



### 1st Level: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your Skill Proficiencies of your choice.

Stealth and Survival are iconic choices for a Ranger if you have Proficiency in them. 

### 1st Level: Favored Enemy

You are adept at focusing your ire on a single foe. You always have the *Hunter's Mark* Spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of Spells you can prepare. Moreover, you don't have to concentrate on the Spell once you cast it; it lasts for its full duration, until you end it as a Bonus Action, or until you are Incapacitated. 

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast Spells. See the *Player's Handbook* for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Ranger.

***Spell Preparation.*** You have the following Spells prepared: *Cure Wounds*, *Guidance*, *Entangle*, and *Thorn Whip*. Alternatively, you can prepare two 0-level Spells and two 1st-level Spells of your choice. Any Spell you prepare for this Class must be a [Primal](/onednd/general/Spellcasting Rules#primal-spells) Spell, and it can be from any School of Magic except Evocation.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can commune with nature and replace any Spell you have prepared for this Class with another Primal Spell of the same level that isn't an Evocation.

At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells, as shown on the Ranger table. The numbers there determine the number of different Spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 3rd-level Ranger, you can prepare two different 0-level Spells and three different 1st-level Spells.

Consult the "Prepared Ranger Spells" section for recommendations on which spells to prepare at higher levels. A Spell marked with a dagger (â€ ) in that section is always prepared and can't be replaced when you prepare Spells.

***Spell Slots.*** The Ranger table shows how many Spell Slots you have at each level to cast your Ranger Spells of 1st level and higher; the number of different Spells you can prepare of each level equals the number of Spell Slots you have at that level. For example, as a 5th-level Ranger, you have four 1st-level Spell Slots and two 2nd-level Spell Slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Ranger Spells.  
***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the Spells you prepare for this Class. 

### 2nd Level: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess. You gain one of the following Fighting Style Feats of your choice: Archery, Defense, or Two-Weapon Fighting.

Whenever you gain a Feat at later levels, Fighting Style Feats are among your options, even though you aren't a member of the Warrior Group. 

### 3rd Level: Ranger Subclass

You gain the [Hunter](/onednd/subclass/Hunter) Subclass or another Ranger Subclass of your choice. The Hunter is detailed after the Ranger's Class description, and other Subclasses will appear in future *Unearthed Arcana* articles.

A Subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your Subclass's features that are of your Ranger level and lower. This Class's description tells you the levels when your Subclass provides features. 

### 4th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 5th Level: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack Action on your turn. 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Ranger Subclass. 

### 7th Level: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy Armor.

You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed. 

### 8th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 9th Level: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your Skill Proficiencies of your choice. 

### 10th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Ranger Subclass. 

### 11th Level: Tireless

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits:

**Temporary Hit Points.** Whenever you finish a Short Rest or a Long Rest, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Proficiency Bonus.  
**Decrease Exhaustion.** If you are Exhausted when you finish a Short Rest, your level of exhaustion decreases by 1. 

### 12th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 13th Level: Nature's Veil

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself from view. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a Spell Slot and become Invisible until the end of your next turn. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Ranger Subclass.

### 15th Level: Feral Senses

Your connection to the forces of nature grants you Blindsight with a range of 30 feet. 

### 16th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice. 

### 18th Level: Foe Slayer

Your *Hunter's Mark* now deals an extra 1d10 damage to its target, rather than an extra 1d6. 

### 19th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice.

### 20th Level: Epic Boon

You gain the Epic Boon of Fortitude Feat or another Epic Boon Feat of your choice.
