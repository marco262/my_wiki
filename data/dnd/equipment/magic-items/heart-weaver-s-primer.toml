description = """
This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: _[[[spell:antipathy/sympathy]]]_, _[[[spell:charm person]]]_, _[[[spell:dominate person]]]_, _[[[spell:enthrall]]]_, _[[[spell:hypnotic pattern]]]_, _[[[spell:modify memory]]]_, and _[[[spell:suggestion]]]_. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.
* When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
