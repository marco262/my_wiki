# Five years ago, the lesser moon Dalamud exploded.
An extended war raged between your country of Eorzea and the Garlean Empire which has conquered half the globe. The Garleans sought to stamp out the menace of Primals: the Beastman tribes' summoned gods. And though Eorzea wished to do the same, Eorzea and Garlemald differed vastly on which means are justified to do so. 

At the climax of the war, the Empire enacted its wild plan to pull the lesser moon Dalamud down from the sky as a giant meteor, and rid the world of the Primal threat altogether.

However, it turns out that Dalamud was no moon: it was a prison for the elder Primal, Bahamut. Bahamut decimated both sides. The Garleans fled, and destruction rained down upon Eorzea. It was only by the daring actions of Archon Louisoix Leveilleur that the people of Eorzea were saved: with a massive spell, Louisoix bound Bahamut to a new prison and teleported Eorzea's people forward in time.

That was the **Calamity of the Seventh Umbral Era**, and Eorzeans have felt the ripples ever since. 

**You are three 2nd-level adventurers.** You have newly turned to the adventuring life, and are currently on a boat on your way to the formerly piratical marine city-state, Limsa Lominsa. You have appointments to meet with **Baderon Tenfingers**, the proprietor of Limsa Lominsa's Adventurers' Guild.

But there are rumblings that the Primal threat is resurfacing across the land…

… a strange cult others call the Paragons have started making moves in the shadows …

… and the Garlean Empire has begun to stir once more …

# In this campaign, expect...
- ...To rise from green adventurers to storied heroes in defense of the realm!
- ...To make dear friends and staunch allies!
- ...To command the helm of an epic tale!
- ...A dense world full of lore, hooks and mystery!
- ...To fight on the side of the Light against the encroaching Darkness!
- ...To engage in politics, supernatural shenanigans, and the plight of the everyman!
- ...The clash of magic versus technology, imperial conquerors versus scrappy city-states!
- ...A game more storyline than sandbox, but your choices and decisions still matter!

## Get Ready!
