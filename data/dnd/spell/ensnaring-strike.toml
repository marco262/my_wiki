description = """The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] by the vines or one that can touch a creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed."""
