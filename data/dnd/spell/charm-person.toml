description = """You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [[[general:conditions#charmed|charmed]]] by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance.

When the spell ends, the creature may make an Intelligence saving throw. If it succeeds, it knows it was charmed by you. In most civilized societies, charming someone can range from a major _faux pas_ to a serious crime."""
