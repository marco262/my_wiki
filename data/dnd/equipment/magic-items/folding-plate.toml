This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield.

If you are not wearing any armor, you can use an action to speak the brooch's command word and cause the brooch to transform in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover you in a complete suit of magical plate armor that provides a +1 bonus to AC. The design of the brooch is displayed on the armor's breastplate. You can use an action to speak the command word again and cause the armor to transform back into the brooch.
