Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or performing elaborate compositions in royal courts, these Bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

### 3rd Level: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain three Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History, and Nature. If you already have one of these Proficiencies, choose a Skill Proficiency you lack, and gain that Proficiency.

### 3rd Level: Cutting Words

You learn how to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on an Ability Check or an Attack Roll, you can use your Reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll, potentially turning it into a failure.

### 6th Level: Cunning Inspiration

Through your studies and your cunning, you've learned to inspire others exceptionally well. When any creature rolls your Bardic Inspiration die, that creature can roll the die twice and use the higher of the two rolls.

### 10th Level: Improved Cutting Words

Whenever you use your Cutting Words feature on a creature, you can deal Psychic Damage to that creature equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier.

### 14th Level: Peerless Skill

When you make an Ability Check and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the Ability Check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, the Bardic Inspiration isn't expended.
