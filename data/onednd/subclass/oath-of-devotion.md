**Tenets of Devotion**

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, Paladins of this oath share these tenets.

***Honesty.*** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

***Courage.*** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

***Compassion.*** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

***Honor.*** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them.

***Duty.*** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the loftiest ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

### 3rd Level: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### 3rd Level: Sacred Weapon

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect as a Bonus Action. This effect also ends if you aren't holding or carrying the weapon or if you have the [[glossary:Incapacitated]] condition.

### 7th Level: Aura of Devotion

You and your allies are immune to the Charmed condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

### 15th Level: Smite of Protection

Your magical smites now radiate protective energy. Whenever you cast any of your Paladin's Smite spells, you and your allies in your Aura of Protection have Half Cover until the start of your next turn.

### 20th Level: Holy Nimbus

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the following benefits for 1 minute or until you end them as a Bonus Action:

**Holy Ward.** You have Advantage on any saving throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an Undead.  
**Radiant Damage.** Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus your Charisma modifier.  
**Sunlight.** The aura is filled with bright light that is sunlight.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[glossary:Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of it by expending a 5th-level spell slot (no action required).
