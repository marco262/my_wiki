description = """You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] for the spell's duration. 

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [[[general:conditions#restrained|restrained]]] target if you do either."""
