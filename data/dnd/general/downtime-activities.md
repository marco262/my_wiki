This page lists extra Downtime Activities options gathered from other source books. Not all of these options will be available to you during your campaign, and your DM has the final say on how any of the mechanics work, regardless of what the text below may say.  

# Dungeon Master's Guide

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 128*

The Player's Handbook describes a few downtime activities to fill the void between adventures. Depending on the style of your campaign and the particular backgrounds and interests of the adventurers, you can make some or all of the following additional activities available as options.

## Building a Stronghold

A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as he or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means.

Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be bought at all.

Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

***Building A Stronghold***

||~ Stronghold ||~ Construction Cost ||~ Construction Time ||
|| Abbey || 50,000 gp || 400 days ||
|| Guildhall, town or city || 5,000 gp || 60 days ||
|| Keep or small castle || 50,000 gp || 400 days ||
|| Noble estate with manor || 25,000 gp || 150 days ||
|| Outpost or fort || 15,000 gp || 100 days ||
|| Palace or large castle || 500,000 gp || 1,200 days ||
|| Temple || 50,000 gp || 400 days ||
|| Tower, fortified || 15,000 gp || 100 days ||
|| Trading post || 5,000 gp || 60 days ||

## Running a Business

Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining the venture and making sure it runs smoothly.

A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), then compares the total to the Running a Business table to determine what happens.

If the character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this manner, the character takes a -10 penalty to subsequent rolls made on this table.

**Running a Business**

||~ d100 ||~ Result ||
|| 01-20 || You must pay one and a half times the business's maintenance cost for each of the days. ||
|| 21-30 || You must pay the business's full maintenance cost for each of the days. ||
|| 31-40 || You must pay half the business's maintenance cost for each of the days. Profits cover the other half. ||
|| 41-60 || The business covers its own maintenance cost for each of the days. ||
|| 61-80 || The business covers its own maintenance cost for each of the days. It earns a profit of 1d6 x 5 gp. ||
|| 81-90 || The business covers its own maintenance cost for each of the days. It earns a profit of 2d8 x 5 gp. ||
|| 91 or higher || The business covers its own maintenance cost for each of the days. It earns a profit of 3d10 x 5 gp. ||

## Sowing Rumors

Swaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's standing in a community or embroil someone in scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard to disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, playing off what people want to believe about the person in question.

Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization requires a number of days depending on the size of the community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a town or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on an adventure for another few days and then returns, the rumor fades away without the benefit of constant repetition.

***Sowing Rumors***

||~ Settlement Size ||~ Time Required ||
|| Village || 2d6 days ||
|| Town || 4d6 days ||
|| City || 6d6 days ||

The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover the cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. At the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the character must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts one step toward friendly or hostile, as the character wishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, and further attempts to propagate it fail.

Shifting a community's general attitude toward a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in the community. Individuals might hold to their own opinions, particularly if they have personal experience in dealing with the subject of the rumors.

# Xanathar's Guide to Everything

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 125*

Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.

Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate about them by email or text, until you next see them in person.

### Resolving Activities

The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.

Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.

The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time; otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see below) and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.

### Complications

The description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.

Each of these sections has a table that offers possible complications. You can roll to determine a complication randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of your own, and then share it with the player.

## Example Downtime Activities

The following activities are suitable for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have the final say on which activities are available to the characters. The activities you allow might depend on the nature of the area where the characters are located. For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items.

### Arena Fighting

Arena fighting includes boxing, wrestling, and other nonlethal forms of combat in an organized setting with predetermined matches.

***Resources.*** Engaging in this activity requires one workweek of effort from a character.

***Resolution.*** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the opposition that the character runs into. A big part of the challenge in arena fighting lies in the unknown nature of a character's opponents. 

The character makes three checks: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), and a special Constitution check that has a bonus equal to a roll of the character's largest Hit Die (this roll doesn't spend that die). If desired, the character can replace one of these skill checks with an attack roll using one of the character's weapons. The DC for each of the checks is determined by the DM. Consult the Arena Fighting Results table to see how the character did. 

||~ Result ||~ Value ||
|| 0 successes || Lose your bouts, earning nothing. ||
|| 1 success || Win 50 gp. ||
|| 2 successes || Win 100 gp. ||
|| 3 successes || Win 200 gp. ||

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***DCs.*** The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one.

***Complications.*** Characters involved in arena fighting must deal with their opponents, the people who bet on matches, and the matches' promoters. Every workweek spent arena fighting brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Arena Fighting Complications table.

**Arena Fighting Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || An opponent swears to take revenge on you.\* ||
|| 2 || A crime boss approaches you and offers to pay you to intentionally lose a few matches.\* ||
|| 3 || You defeat a popular local champion, drawing the crowd's ire. ||
|| 4 || You defeat a noble's servant, drawing the wrath of the noble's house.\* ||
|| 5 || You are accused of cheating. Whether the allegation is true or not, your reputation is tarnished.\* ||
|| 6 || You accidentally deliver a near-fatal wound to a foe. ||

*Might involve a rival

### Buying a Magic Item

Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires.

***Resources.*** Finding magic items to purchase requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp in expenses, if you are seeking items of rarity Uncommon or above. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item.

***Resolution.*** A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine the quality of the seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential business partners.

The total of the check dictates what magic items are likely to be found, with a higher check resulting in more valuable (i.e. expensive) items. If a character is looking for a more specific value of magic item, the DM will adjust the results to match, assuming the character rolls high enough. 

If the character seeks a specific magic item, the desired item may be included among the items for sale on a check total of 10 or higher if the item is common, 15 or higher if it is uncommon, 20 or higher if it is rare, 25 or higher if it is very rare, and 30 or higher if it is legendary.

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Resolution.*** As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Or you can roll for items from any table associated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. As a further option to reflect the availability of items in your campaign, you can apply a -10 penalty for low magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs in low magic campaigns.

The [Magic Item Generator](/dnd/equipment/magic_item_generator/) provides a convenient way to roll on the required tables, and also includes magic items from outside the DMG.

**Buying Magic Items**

||~ Check Total || Items Acquired ||
|| 1-5 || Roll 1d6 times on Magic Item Table A. ||
|| 6-10 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table B. ||
|| 11-15 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table C. ||
|| 16-20 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table D. ||
|| 21-25 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table E. ||
|| 26-30 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table F. ||
|| 31-35 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table G. ||
|| 36-40 || Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table H. ||
|| 41+ ||Roll 1d4 times on Magic Item Table I. ||

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll, when using the table to determine an asking price.

**Magic Item Price**

||~ Rarity ||~ Asking Price* || 
|| Common || (1d6 + 1) x 10 gp ||
|| Uncommon || 1d6 x 100 gp ||
|| Rare || 2d10 x 1,000 gp ||
|| Very rare || (1d4 + 1) x 10,000 gp ||
|| Legendary || 2d6 x 25,000 gp ||

\*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

You have final say in determining which items are for sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say.

***Complications.*** The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If you want to make things more interesting for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase Complications table or invent your own complication.

**Magic Item Purchase Complications**

||~ d12 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || The item is a fake, planted by an enemy.\* ||
|| 2 || The item is stolen by the party's enemies.\* ||
|| 3 || The item is cursed by a god. ||
|| 4 || The item's original owner will kill to reclaim it; the party's enemies spread news of its sale.\* ||
|| 5 || The item is at the center of a dark prophecy. ||
|| 6 || The seller is murdered before the sale.\* ||
|| 7 || The seller is a devil looking to make a bargain. ||
|| 8 || The item is the key to freeing an evil entity. ||
|| 9 || A third party bids o n the item, doubling its price.\* ||
|| 10 || The item is an enslaved, intelligent entity. ||
|| 11 || The item is tied to a cult. ||
|| 12 || The party's enemies spread rumors that the item is an artifact of evil.\* ||

\*Might involve a rival

### Carousing

Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?

***Resources.*** Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.

***Resolution.*** After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Carousing table.

**Carousing**

||~ Check Total ||~ Result ||
|| 1-5 || Character has made a hostile contact. ||
|| 6-10 || Character has made no new contacts. ||
|| 11-15 || Character has made an allied contact. ||
|| 16-20 || Character has made two allied contacts. ||
|| 21+ || Character has made three allied contacts. ||

Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.

Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.

Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.

Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.

Alternatively, you can make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game, and the DM is the final arbiter if this explanation is sufficient.

At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Resolution.*** You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.

Using a mix of the above and allowing players to designate NPCs as contacts is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.

***Complications.*** Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. As a rule of thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek of carousing.

**Lower-Class Carousing Complications**

||~ d8 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || A pickpocket lifts 1d10 x 5 gp from you.\* ||
|| 2 || A bar brawl leaves you with a scar.\* ||
|| 3 || You have fuzzy memories of doing something very, very illegal, but can't remember exactly what. ||
|| 4 || You are banned from a tavern after some obnoxious behavior.\* ||
|| 5 || After a few drinks, you swore in the town square to pursue a dangerous quest. ||
|| 6 || Surprise! You're married. ||
|| 7 || Streaking naked through the streets seemed like a great idea at the time. ||
|| 8 || Everyone is calling you by some weird, embarrassing nickname, like Puddle Drinker or Bench Slayer, and no one will say why. ||

**Middle-Class Carousing Complications**

||~ d8 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || You accidentally insulted a guild master, and only a public apology will let you do business with the guild again.* ||
|| 2 || You swore to complete some quest on behalf of a temple or a guild. ||
|| 3 || A social gaffe has made you the talk of the town.* ||
|| 4 || A particularly obnoxious person has taken an intense romantic interest in you.* ||
|| 5 || You have made a foe out of a local spellcaster.* ||
|| 6 || You have been recruited to help run a local festival, play, or similar event. ||
|| 7 || You made a drunken toast that scandalized the locals. ||
|| 8 || You spent an additional 100 gp trying to impress people. ||

**Upper-Class Carousing Complications**

||~ d8 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || A pushy noble family wants to marry off one of their scions to you.\* ||
|| 2 || You tripped and fell during a dance, and people can't stop talking about it. ||
|| 3 || You have agreed to take on a noble's debts. ||
|| 4 || You have been challenged to a joust by a knight.\* ||
|| 5 || You have made a foe out ofa local noble.\* ||
|| 6 || A boring noble insists you visit each day and listen to long, tedious theories of magic. ||
|| 7 || You have become the target of a variety of embarrassing rumors.\* ||
|| 8 || You spent an additional 500 gp trying to impress people. ||

### Crafting an Item

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

***Resources and Resolution.*** In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. The DM determines how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers. NPC hirelings can help with the crafting, but more skilled NPCs will require more expensive wages. 

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. 

||~ Proficiency ||~ Items ||
|| Herbalism kit || Antitoxin, potion of healing ||
|| Leatherworker's tools || Leather armor, boots ||
|| Smith's tools || Armor, weapons ||
|| Weaver's tools || Cloaks, robes ||

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.

***Crafting Magic Items.*** Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

_Potions of healing_ and _spell scrolls_ are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see "Brewing Potions of Healing" later in this section and the "Scribing a Spell Scroll" activity.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

A magic item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material will involve a side quest, or may come up as part of the normal adventure.

In addition to requiring an exotic material, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

**Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost**

||~ Item Rarity ||~ Workweeks* ||~ Cost* || 
|| Common || 1 || 50 gp ||
|| Uncommon || 2 || 200 gp ||
|| Rare || 10 || 2,000 gp ||
|| Very rare || 25 || 20,000 gp ||
|| Legendary || 50 || 100,000 gp ||

\*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

***Brewing Potions of Healing.*** Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the following table.

||~ Type ||~ Amount Healed ||~ Time ||~ Cost ||
|| Healing || 2d4 + 2 || 1 day || 25 gp ||
|| Greater healing || 4d4 + 4 || 1 workweek || 100 gp ||
|| Superior healing || 8d4 + 8 || 3 workweeks || 1,000 gp ||
|| Supreme healing || 10d4 + 20 || 4 workweeks || 10,000 gp ||

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Crafting Items.*** You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment to make an item. The following table provides some examples.

||~ Proficiency ||~ Items ||
|| Herbalism kit || Antitoxin, potion of healing ||
|| Leatherworker's tools || Leather armor, boots ||
|| Smith's tools || Armor, weapons ||
|| Weaver's tools || Cloaks, robes ||

***Crafting Magic Items.*** The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

**Magic Item Ingredients**

||~ Item Rarity ||~ CR Range ||
|| Common || 1-3 ||
|| Uncommon || 4-8 ||
|| Rare || 9-12 ||
|| Very rare || 13-18 ||
|| Legendary || 19+ ||

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating _mariner's armor_ might require the essence of a water weird. Crafting a _staff of charming_ might require the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a _staff of power_ might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic -- a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.

***Complications.*** Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, a re linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.

**Crafting Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || Rumors swirl that what you're working on is unstable and a threat to the community.\* ||
|| 2 || Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.\* ||
|| 3 || A local wizard shows keen interest in your work and insists on observing you. ||
|| 4 || A powerful noble offers a hefty price for your work and is not interested in hearing no for an answer.\* ||
|| 5 || A dwarf clan accuses you of stealing its secret lore to fuel your work.\* ||
|| 6 || A competitor spreads rumors that your work is shoddy and prone to failure.\* ||

### Crime

Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

***Resources.*** A character must spend one week and at least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.

***Resolution.*** The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime.

The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, or 25. Successful completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces, as shown on the Loot Value table.

**Loot Value**

||~ DC ||~ Value ||
|| 10 || 50 gp, robbery of a struggling merchant ||
|| 15 || 100 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant ||
|| 20 || 200 gp, robbery of a noble ||
|| 25 || 1,000 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town ||

To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity (Stealth), Dexterity using thieves' tools, and the player's choice of Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception).

If none of the checks are successful, the character is caught and jailed. The character's punishment is subject to the laws of the location the crime was committed in, or whoever ended up arresting the character, subject to DM discretion.

If only one check is successful, the heist fails but the character escapes.

If two checks are successful, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.

If all three checks are successful, the character earns the full value of the loot.

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Resolution.*** If the character rolls no successes, he must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine. 

***Complications.*** A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check. If the character's rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks.

**Crime Complications**

|| 1 || A bounty equal to your earnings is offered for information about your crime.\* ||
|| 2 || An unknown person contacts you, threatening to reveal your crime if you don't render a service.\* ||

### Gambling

Games of chance are a way to make a fortune -- and perhaps a better way to lose one.

***Resources.*** This activity requires one workweek of effort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp. Higher stakes may be acceptable in exceptional cases.

***Resolution.*** The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table.

The character makes three checks: Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception), and Charisma (Intimidation). If the character has proficiency with an appropriate gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks. The DM will determine the DC for each of the checks. Consult the following table to see how the character did.

**Gambling Results**

|| Result || Value || 
|| 0 successes || Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount. ||
|| 1 success || Lose half the money you bet. ||
|| 2 successes || Gain the amount you bet plus half again more. ||
|| 3 successes || Gain double the amount you bet. ||

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***DCs.*** The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one.

***Complications.*** Gambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. Every workweek spent gambling brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Gambling Complications table.

**Gambling Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || You are accused of cheating. You decide whether you actually did cheat or were framed.\* ||
|| 2 || The town guards raid the gambling hall and throw you in jail.\* ||
|| 3 || A noble in town loses badly to you and loudly vows to get revenge.\* ||
|| 4 || You won a sum from a low-ranking member of a thieves' guild, and the guild wants its money back. ||
|| 5 || A local crime boss insists you start frequenting the boss's gambling parlor and no others. ||
|| 6 || A high-stakes gambler comes to town and insists that you take part in a game. ||

### Managing a Business (homebrew)

A successful business requires a savvy manager to truly prosper. 

The business gains +10 to its roll for determining its profits if at least one character spends their downtime managing it. For every consecutive workweek spent managing the business, gain an extra +10, up to a maximum of +30. Multiple characters managing the business at once do not provide extra bonuses.

### Relaxation

Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don't want to make use of the downtime system.

***Resources.*** Relaxation requires one week. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.

***Resolution.*** Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Complications.*** Relaxation rarely comes with complications. If you want to make life complicated for the characters, introduce an action or an event connected to a rival.

[[/accordion]]

### Religious Service

Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in ser vice to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple's leaders.

***Resources.*** Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character's. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.

***Resolution.*** At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Wisdom (Religion) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the following table.

||~ Check Total ||~ Result ||
|| 1-10 || No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression. ||
|| 11-20 || You earn one favor. ||
|| 21+ || You earn two favors. ||

A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. A favor could also take the form of a deity's intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.

Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Complications.*** Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every workweek spent in religious service brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Religious Service Complications table.

**Religious Service Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || You have offended a priest through your words or actions.\* ||
|| 2 || Blasphemy is sti ll blasphemy, even if you did it by accident. ||
|| 3 || A secret sect in the temple offers you membership. ||
|| 4 || Another temple tries to recruit you as a spy.\* ||
|| 5 || The temple elders implore you to take up a holy quest. ||
|| 6 || You accidentally discover that an important person in the temple is a fiend worshiper. ||

### Renovating a Business (homebrew)

When running a business, it's important to keep on top of maintenance, and even moreso to work to update and improve your business to keep your customers' interest. Renovations can consist of planting a garden, fixing holes in the wall, replacing wallpaper, or even adding a disco dance area to the attic.

***Resources.*** Regardless of what the renovation entails, it always requires 5 gp in materials or hired labor per workweek spent. Some types of renovation may require multiple weeks of work to complete.

***Resolution.*** The character decides what kind of renovation they're performing. At the end of the workweek, the character makes an appropriate ability check, plus any skill or tool proficiencies that can apply. Consult the Renovation Result table to determine what bonus is gained on the business's roll for determining its profits for that week.

**Renovation Result**

||~ Check ||~ Result ||
|| 9 or lower || The renovations are botched and need to be redone. No bonus. ||
|| 10-14 || +5 ||
|| 15-20 || +10 ||
|| 21+ || +20 ||

If renovations are left uncompleted, the business suffers a -10 penalty for every week thereafter until the renovations are complete. Multiple characters can work on renovations for the business at once, and their bonuses stack.

### Research

Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

***Resources.*** Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

***Resolution.*** The character declares the focus of the research -- a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check. Determine how much lore a character learns using the following table.

||~ Check Total ||~ Outcome ||
|| 1-5 || No effect. ||
|| 6-10 || You learn one piece of lore. ||
|| 11-20 || You learn two pieces of lore. ||
|| 21+ || You learn three pieces of lore! ||

Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Resolution.*** As DM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place. 

***Complications.*** The greatest risk in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during research. Every workweek spent in research brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Research Complications table.

**Research Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || You accidentally damage a rare book. ||
|| 2 || You offend a sage, who demands an extravagant gift.\* ||
|| 3 || If you had known that book was cursed, you never would have opened it. ||
|| 4 || A sage becomes obsessed with convincing you of a number of strange theories about reality.\* ||
|| 5 || Your actions cause you to be banned from a library until you make reparations.\* ||
|| 6 || You uncovered useful lore, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return. ||

### Scribing a Spell Scroll

With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a _spell scroll_.

***Resources.*** Scribing a _spell scroll_ takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

**Spell Scroll Costs**

||~ Spell Level ||~ Time ||~ Cost ||
|| Cantrip || 1 day || 15 gp ||
|| 1st || 1 day || 25 gp ||
|| 2nd || 3 days || 250 gp ||
|| 3rd || 1 workweek || 500 gp ||
|| 4th || 2 workweeks || 2,500 gp ||
|| 5th || 4 workweeks || 5,000 gp ||
|| 6th || 8 workweeks || 15,000 gp ||
|| 7th || 16 workweeks || 25,000 gp ||
|| 8th || 32 workweeks || 50,000 gp ||
|| 9th || 48 workweeks || 250,000 gp ||

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Complications.*** Crafting a _spell scroll_ is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complications that arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed for the activity. Every workweek spent scribing brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Scribe a Scroll Complications table.

**Scribe a Scroll Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || You bought up the last of the rare ink used to craft scrolls, angering a wizard in town. ||
|| 2 || The priest of a temple of good accuses you of trafficking in dark magic.\* ||
|| 3 || A wizard eager to collect one of your spells in a book presses you to sell the scroll. ||
|| 4 || Due to a strange error in creating the scroll, it is instead a random spell of the same level. ||
|| 5 || The rare parchment you bought for your scroll has a barely visible map on it. ||
|| 6 || A thief attempts to break into your workroom.\* ||

### Selling a Magic Item

Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

***Resources.*** A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one week and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.

***Resolution.*** A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the week of effort and trying again later. Use Magic Item Base Prices table to determine the base sale price (halved for consumable items). The result of your check will determine whether a buyer is willing to pay above or below the base sale price.

||~ Rarity ||~ Base Price\* ||
|| Common || 100 gp ||
|| Uncommon || 400 gp ||
|| Rare || 4,000 gp ||
|| Very rare || 40,000 gp ||
|| Legendary || 200,000 gp ||

\*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

[[accordion DM Notes]]

**Magic Item Offer**

||~ Check Total ||~ Offer ||
|| 1-10 || 50% of base price ||
|| 11-20 || 100% of base price ||
|| 21+ || 150% of base price ||

***Complications.*** The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.

**Magic Item Sale Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || Your enemy secretly arranges to buy the item to use it against you.\* ||
|| 2 || A thieves' guild, alerted to the sale, attempts to steal your item.\* ||
|| 3 || A foe circulates rumors that your item is a fake.\* ||
|| 4 || A sorcerer claims your item as a birthright and demands you hand it over. ||
|| 5 || Your item's previous owner, or surviving allies of the owner, vow to retake the item by force. ||
|| 6 || The buyer is murdered before the sale is finalized. :)\* ||

### Training

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language, pick up proficiency with a tool, or retrain an existing skill proficiency to another skill proficiency.

***Resources.*** Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.

If the character is retraining a skill and has chosen an Expertise in that skill proficiency, they can choose to change that Expertise to match the new skill they're retraining into.

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Complications.*** Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.

**Training Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||  
|| 1 || Your instructor disappears, forcing you to spend one workweek finding a new one.\* ||
|| 2 || Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others. ||
|| 3 || Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans.\* ||
|| 4 || Your teacher is a wanted criminal. ||
|| 5 || Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster. ||
|| 6 || Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat. ||

### Work

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

***Resources.*** Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

***Resolution.*** To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma (Performance), or Charisma using a musical instrument. Consult the following table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check. 

||~ Check Total ||~ Earnings ||
|| 9 or lower || Poor lifestyle for the week ||
|| 10-14 || Modest lifestyle for the week ||
|| 15-20 || Comfortable lifestyle for the week ||
|| 21+ || Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp ||

[[accordion DM Notes]]

***Complications.*** Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a character encounters a complication.

**Work Complications**

||~ d6 ||~ Complication ||
|| 1 || A difficult customer or a fight with a coworker reduces the wages you earn by one category.\* ||
|| 2 || Your employer's financial difficulties result in your not being paid.\* ||
|| 3 || A coworker with ties to an important family in town takes a dislike to you.\* ||
|| 4 || Your employer is involved with a dark cult or a criminal enterprise. ||
|| 5 || A crime ring targets your business for extortion.\* ||
|| 6 || You gain a reputation for laziness (unjustified or not, as you choose), giving you disadvantage on checks made for this downtime activity for the next six workweeks you devote to it.\* ||
