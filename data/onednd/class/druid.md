**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, weather, and the four elements, Druids can heal, transform themselves, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from a nature deity, from nature itself, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids in performing rites to mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.

Druids master Primal magic, which is oriented toward nature and animals -- the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some Druids focus on this practice, even to the point where they feel more natural in an animal form.

For Druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world -- air, earth, fire, and water -- must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, Druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.

Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

## Druid Class Features

[[div class="phb-sidebar"]]

**Multiclassing and the Druid**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Druid as one of your Classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Druid's primary ability, Wisdom, to take a level in this Class or to take a level in another Class if you are already a Druid.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Druid level, you gain Armor Training with the following: Light Armor and Shields.

***Spell Slots.*** Add all your Druid levels to the appropriate levels from other Classes to determine your available Spell Slots for casting Spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare Spells for each of your Classes individually, referring to the Spell Slots of an individual Class to determine the number and levels of the Spells you prepare for it.

[[/div]]

As a Druid, you gain the following Class Features when you reach the specified levels in this Class. These features are listed on the Druid table.

### 1st Level: Channel Nature

The magic of nature infuses you. Tapping into that power, you can create various magical effects. You start with one such effect: Wild Shape, which is described below. Other Druid features give additional Channel Nature effect options. Each time you use this Channel Nature, you choose which effect to create from among those you have from this class.

You can use Channel Nature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Channel Nature column of the Druid table.

If a Channel Nature effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

***Wild Shape.*** As a Magic action, you transform into a form that you have learned for this feature. You start knowing one form, Animal of the Land, which is detailed in the [Wild Shapes](#wild-shapes) section later in this class's description. You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also end Wild Shape early as a Bonus Action.

While in a form, its game statistics replace yours, and your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs, rather than your own. You retain your personality, memories, ability to speak, and Wild Shape. You lose access to all your other features, such as the ability to cast spells (you can continue to concentrate on one).

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. 

### 1st Level: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages.

You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic. 

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Druid.

***Prepared Spells.*** You have the following spells prepared: _[[[spell:Cure Wounds]]]_, _[[[spell:Druidcraft]]]_, _[[[spell:Produce Flame]]]_, and _[[[spell:Thunderwave]]]_. Alternatively, you can prepare two 0-level spells (also known as cantrips) and two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Primal spell list.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can meditate and replace any spell you have prepared for this class with another Primal spell of the same level.

At higher levels in this class, you can prepare more spells, as shown on the Druid table. The numbers there determine the number of different spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 4th-level Druid, you can prepare three different 0-level spells, four different 1st- level spells, and three different 2nd-level spells.

***Spell Slots.*** When you cast a prepared Druid spell, you expend a Spell Slot. The number of Spell Slots you have of 1st-level and higher is the same as the number of different spells you can prepare of each level, as shown on the Druid table. For example, as a 5th-level Druid, you have four 1st-level Spell Slots, three 2nd-level Spell Slots, and two 3rd-level Spell Slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Druid spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class. 

### 2nd Level: Nature's Aid

You learn two more ways to use your Channel Nature -- Healing Blossoms and Wild Companion -- each of which is described below.

***Healing Blossoms.*** As a Magic action, you channel healing energy that appears as blooming flowers. Choose a point within 30 feet of yourself, and spectral flowers appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Then roll a number of d4s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die), and add the dice together. The total is the number of Hit Points you can distribute to creatures in that sphere. You decide the number of Hit Points that are restored to each of those creatures, deducting the healing from the total.

***Wild Companion.*** You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Channel Nature and cast the _[[[spell:Find Familiar]]]_ spell without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a Fey, and it disappears when you finish a Long Rest. 

### 3rd Level: Druid Subclass

You gain the [Circle of the Moon](/onednd/subclass/Circle of the Moon) subclass or another Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Moon is detailed after the Druid's class description, and other subclasses will appear in future _Unearthed Arcana_ articles.

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Druid level and lower. This class's description tells you the levels when your subclass provides features. 

### 4th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 5th Level: Might of the Land

Your connection to the land deepens, empowering the Animal of the Land form of your Wild Shape; you unlock that form's Climb Speed and Multiattack. 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Druid subclass. 

### 7th Level: Aquatic Form

You learn a new form for your Wild Shape: Animal of the Sea, which is described in the [Wild Shapes](#wild-shapes) section later in this class's description. 

### 8th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 9th Level: Aerial Form

You learn a new form for your Wild Shape: Animal of the Sky, which is described in the [Wild Shapes](#wild-shapes) section later in this class's description. 

### 10th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Druid subclass. 

### 11th Level: Tiny Critter

You gain the ability to become a Tiny creature. When you transform into a Wild Shape form, you can make it Tiny. If you do so, you can stay in that form no longer than 10 minutes, and the damage you deal in that form is halved. 

### 12th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 13th Level: Alternating Forms

You can now rapidly shift between a Wild Shape form and your normal form. If you're in a Wild Shape form, you can switch to your normal form as a Bonus Action, and you can then switch back into that Wild Shape form within the next minute as a Bonus Action. Neither switch expends a use of Wild Shape. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Druid subclass. 

### 15th Level: Wild Resurgence

When you use your Wild Shape, primal magic radiates from you, allowing you to use Healing Blossoms as part of the same use of Channel Nature. 

### 16th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 17th Level: Beast Spells

You can cast spells in any Wild Shape form. While in such a form, you can perform Somatic and Verbal Components, and you don't need to provide free Material Components. If a spell consumes its Material Component, you can't cast that spell while in a Wild Shape form. 

### 18th Level: Archdruid

Whenever you roll Initiative, you regain one use of your Channel Nature.

In addition, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. 

### 19th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 20th Level: Epic Boon

You gain the following benefits:

***Ability Score Increase.*** Choose one of your ability scores. That score increases by 2, and this increase can raise the score above 20 but not above 30.

***Epic Boon Feat.*** You gain the Epic Boon of Spell Recall or another Epic Boon feat of your choice.

## Wild Shapes

When you use your Wild Shape, you transform into a form you've learned for this feature. This section includes three forms: Animal of the Land, Animal of the Sea, and Animal of the Sky.

As you assume a form, you determine its appearance, selecting an example animal from the form's description, selecting another appropriate animal, or choosing a hybrid form that incorporates visual characteristics from two or more animals. The appearance you choose has no effect on the form's capabilities.

When choosing an animal's appearance for a form, that animal needn't be the same size as the form. For example, you could choose elephant for the appearance and Small for the size -- creating a form that resembles a little elephant.

### Animal of the Land

An Animal of the Land is a flightless terrestrial animal, such as a bear, deer, horse, cat, dog, velociraptor, or big rodent. While in this form, you use the Animal of the Land stat block.
