### [Lord's Landing](Lord's Landing)

## Notes

* The players need to find the Dread Pirate Lord's first mate, who is hiding on the Dread Pirate Lord's HQ island.
    * She's a half-elf, so she has not aged as much as everyone else. Maybe a cleric so she can create food and shelter for herself?
    * Knows Scrying, but doesn't have a focus. Quest for players later?
    * Stays on the HQ island, because she's been foiling the Knights of Twilight's attempts to uncover the DPL's treasure for 20 goddamn years
* Players need to search for the first mate but have no idea where she is:
    * Need ideas on where to find her (need informants, guides)
    * Need access to the islands for either exploration or just getting to the first mate
* The players' options for getting to the island are:
    * Buy/steal a boat: Easiest but dangerous. The waters beyond the shoreline are not safe, because of pirates, wildlife, and weather.
    * Buy/steal a ship: Much safer but much more difficult. Will need to overpower a whole crew, and then manage the ship themselves.
    * Swim/fly: Dangerous (see Buying a Boat) and tiring. But doable, especially if Rek carries Azurhel.
* Each of the lieutenants has magical gear that is secretly cursed, so that the Dread Pirate Lord can shut them down if they try to turn on him. Give these items to the players.
* Dread Pirate HQ has been taken over by the Knights of Twilight and is strictly off-limits to anyone.
    * Knights of Twilight are trying to pop open a vault that was recently uncovered, which contains powerful treasure that the Dread Pirate is trying to lead the players to.

### Ways to Get Money

## Player Plans

Find dude and assassinate him

## My Plans

* [Weapon Shop Robbery](weapon-shop-robbery)
* [Making Friends in Lord's Landing](Making Friends in Lord's Landing)
* [Someone Needs To Die](Someone Needs To Die)
* [A Brief Respite](A Brief Respite)

## TODO

### Before next session

* Add distance legend to the world map
* Come up with name/description/bodyguards for target (Rek is doing recon)
* Come up with what they find at the museum at the castle
* Come up with evil magic items for Nic (baby armor for one of them)
* Add Downtime Activities link to the main wiki page
* Invent Druid book club for Zoya
* Zoya wants to get into the Knights of Twilight to sabotage them. Think of ways that she could get in on them.

### Later...

* Design at least two islands
    * HQ island has a VOLCANO! :O
* Figure out what the Dread Pirate Lord can provide, other than quests
    * Advantage on skill checks, esp. knowledge checks
* Remake map to have multiple "layers" of islands (3-4) with the HQ island as the last one.
    * Progressively more dangerous waters between layers
* Come up with names and identities for the four pirate fleets

## Hooks to keep in mind

* Have the Dread Pirate Lord drop hints to a great treasure hidden in the depths of his HQ
* Introduce Knights of Twilight as elite guard that are very dangerous to cross
* Plant seeds of Dread Pirate Lord's lieutenants having powerful magic items and cool ships
* Find ways to emphasize dangers of the sea before they have to fight it
* String quests together (e.g. during goblin hunting, plant hook to another quest)
    * Hooks in some quests can be just partial hooks to later quests; need multiple hooks to get later quests
* Drop connections in some places to history of raiding/connection to lieutenants
* Come up with stories of the Dread Pirate Lord when he was a youngun that he can use for advice or parables
* Have them pass a ship full of characters from the other campaign (descriptions TBD)
