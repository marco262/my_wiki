You summon nature spirits that flit about you for the duration. Until the spell ends, each creature you choose that enters a space within 10 feet of you for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, you can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action for the spell's duration.
