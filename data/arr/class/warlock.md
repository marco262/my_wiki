A lalafell stands before a horde of kobolds who dash towards him with blood-thirsty screams. With a few skillful waves of his staff, a large fireball erupts from the gem inlaid at the end of the staff, causing a massive fiery explosion and leaving nothing but ash.

A miqo'te wearing dark robes grins as she waves her wand before a guard refusing her entry. With a few choice words and a spell, the guard happily steps aside, unlocking the passage bowing to her as she passes.

An elezen laughs as he unleashes a fireball empowered by dark magics upon his foes, its umbral hue at once dazzling and unsettling.

A warlock is a powerful ally who wields incredible magic granted to them by a mysterious and otherworldly patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of their patrons, they piece together the arcane secrets that bolster their incredible power.

### Sworn & Beholden
A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not of the Twelve gods you know. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice: the warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.

The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.

### Delvers into Secrets
Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well. Warlocks of Eorzea are few and far between, for it seems the supernatural forces of the world are very picky about whom they champion. But you are one of the oh-so-lucky few, and you are often visited by the vision of your patron in your dreams.

Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.

### Adjustments
In addition to the base qualities of the class in the Player's Handbook, warlocks in Eorzea have the following adjustments.

#### Warlock Patrons
You may select from the following Warlock Patrons:

| Archetype  | Source |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  The Emissary  | *Homebrew* |
|  The Mothercrystal  | *Homebrew* |
|  The Negotiator  | *Homebrew* |

## The Emissary
You have made your pact with the Emissary: a mysterious man clad in white who is gentle and quiet, but radiates power. He aids those whom He deems capable of rising up in defense of the Light, in order to restore balance to the star.

### Expanded Spell List
The Emissary lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1st  | *bane, shield* |
|  2nd  | *blindness/deafness, blur* |
|  3rd  | *crusader's mantle, elemental weapon* |
|  4th  | *aura of purity, staggering smite* |
|  5th  | *dispel evil and good, holy weapon* |

### Warrior's Challenge
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to issue a challenge to your opponents. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is challenged to combat for 1 minute. The challenge ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the challenge ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain your proficiency bonus to damage rolls against the challenged target.
* Any attack roll you make against the challenged creature is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
* If the challenged creature attacks a creature other than you, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or else make the attack roll with disadvantage.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Crusader of Balance
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

If you have the *eldritch blast* cantrip, you can choose at the start of your action when casting it to change its damage type to radiant.

### Blade of Light
At 6th level, your patron grants you the power to imbue your blade with spells, uniting your melee prowess and spellcasting ability in combat. If you are channeling your will through a melee weapon using the Crusader of Balance feature, you can enchant the weapon with a spell as a bonus action instead of casting it, though it uses the same components. The spell must be a harmful spell which requires one or more targets other than yourself and which requires a saving throw from each. Your weapon can be imbued with no more than one spell at a time.

The enchantment has a number of charges equal to the number of targets allowed by the spell, and its duration, equal to that of the spell, begins when it is placed upon the weapon. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one charge of the enchantment to make them the target of the spell, against which they make their initial saving throw with disadvantage. When the duration of the enchantment has elapsed, the effects of the spell ends on each target, and unused charges are removed from the weapon.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Armor of Darkness
At 10th level, you have come to understand the necessity of balance. Your resolve and reflexes have been fortified with shadow, making you a more imposing challenger. If the target of your Warrior's Challenge hits you with an attack, roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the shadows of Hydaelyn envelope you, causing the attack to miss.

### Champion of the Emissary
Starting at 14th level, you can pass your Warrior's Challenge from a slain foe to one who still stands. When the target of your Warrior's Challenge dies, you can apply the challenge to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated.

## The Mothercrystal
Your patron is the great aether crystal and mother goddess of Hydaelyn, the mothercrystal Herself. At Her aetherial command, you have bound yourself to her Light and sworn to do Her bidding in exchange for the awe-inspiring touch of Her power. 

Being connected so strongly to such a power can cause changes to your behavior and beliefs. You might find yourself driven to annihilate the undead, to defeat fiends, and to protect the innocent. At times, your heart might also be filled with a longing for the Aetherial Sea, to lay down your ever-increasing burden and become one with Her Light. But you know your mission is among the living for now, and your pact binds you to bring Her light to the dark places of the world.

### Expanded Spell List
The Mothercrystal lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1st  | *cure wounds, guiding bolt* |
|  2nd  | *lesser restoration, spiritual weapon* |
|  3rd  | *daylight, revivify* |
|  4th  | *aura of life, guardian of faith* |
|  5th  | *dawn, greater restoration* |

### Bonus Cantrips
At 1st level, you learn the light and sacred flame cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don't count against your number of cantrips known.

### Healing Light
At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel the light of the Crystal to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.

As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Radiant Soul
Starting at 6th level, your link to the Mothercrystal allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.

### Crystalline Resistance
Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.

### Searing Vengeance
Starting at 14th level, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and is blinded until the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## The Negotiator
You have made a pact with a being whose existence is shrouded in mystery to you. Though He has never come to you Himself, He sends his messages and requests through others around you, be they your allies, random strangers, or even your foes. Often the tasks He sets you to are strange or confusing, yet harmless: to leave a parcel here, or pass along news there. You might wonder about His motivations, but you know He is a man of His word, and He has always kept His side of the pact. 

### Expanded Spell List
The Negotiator lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. 

| Spell Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1st  | *command, disguise self* |
|  2nd  | *blindness/deafness, detect thoughts* |
|  3rd  | *melf's minute meteors, slow* |
|  4th  | *confusion, evard's black tentacles* |
|  5th  | *dominate person, seeming* |

### Negotiator's Blessing
Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

### Broker Your Luck
Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Defy Fate
Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

### Mind of the Void
Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the Void. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of the next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend (voidsent), it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
