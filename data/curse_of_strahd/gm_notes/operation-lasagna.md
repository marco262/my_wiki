The players left Baba Lysaga's house (with a familiar with a connection to Baba Lysaga) and immediately went to start talking with the Keepers of the Feather and Uncle David. They went through a bunch of plans to distract her and mess with her house and the like, until Uncle David pointed out their familiar is a spy for her. They smashed the familiar, and have to assume Baba Lysaga heard everything they planned.

So the players now have to come up with new plans. >:) Current plans include:

* Hunt down an NPC to help them plan (they want to hunt down Van Richten)
* Use wolf musk somehow (I love this, make this work!)

Van Richten will not necessarily be easy to find, but there should be ways to get to him.

* Most obvious one is to check out his tower. He will either be there, or will be there eventually.
* Hire someone to cast Sending. Harder to accomplish, since there are very few spellcasters in Barovia who can cast 3rd level spells.
  * Ezmerelda? The Abbot?
* Paper Birds? Where would they find them?
  * Remember that anyone in Van Richten's Tower is protected from Divination magic, including Sending or Paper Birds.
* Ask Keepers of the Feather to keep an eye out for him
* Any scheme the players want to come up with

Van Richten will be reluctant to help them. Baba Lysaga is not an Elder Vampire, she's dangerous, and is not a direct ally of Strahd. He does know that Strahd is protected by the Fanes, but doesn't know Baba Lysaga has one of the keys. If the players reveal she's in possession of the spindle, he'll quickly put the pieces together and decide to help them out. Van Richten will insist on having further discussions at his tower, and Detect Magic up at all times to determine if divination magic is nearby while they're on their way.

Once they're safe and Van Richten has been briefed, he will send a Sending to Ezmerelda and have her meet him at the tower to share more information.

Van Richten will come up with an excuse to talk to Ireena alone. Giving her cleric lessons? Make it Ireena's idea? He will want to convince her that one viable option to end Strahd forever is to go through with the Bride Ceremony, and kill herself in the middle of it. 

Why would Ireena agree? Van Richten will appeal to her sense of duty and the value of noble sacrifice. She can be the one to free all the people in Barovia from Strahd's Curse. He'll also convince her to not share this plan with the heroes, because Strahd is painfully smart, deceitful, and can scry just as well as Baba Lysaga. The PCs are also not the most discreet folks around, so the fewer people that know this plan, the better.

# What Van Richten and Ezmerelda Have Been Up To

## Van Richten

* Traveling, keeping to the road, or staying at his tower.
* Visited the Village of Barovia to gather as much info on Strahd as he possibly could. Not much to learn that he didn't already know, unfortunately.
* Visited Old Bonegrinder for a "social visit" with the hags who live there. Stumbled upon the Forest Fane, but didn't know what it was at the time.
* Visited the Abbey, met the Abbot and Mordenkainen. Has *questions* for the PCs about that.
* Investigating the local Werewolf Den
  * A new Werewolf Alpha has taken leadership of the Den, and Van Richten thinks he can be swayed to not work so closely with Strahd

## Ezmerelda

At Van Richten's request, she's been hiding our near Castle Ravenloft, sending raven familiars into the Castle to scout the place out. Hasn't had much, if any, interaction with the rest of Barovia since she last met the players.

She's found the [Heart of Sorrow](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,5,k20.%20heart%20of%20sorrow) in Castle Ravenloft, but doesn't know what it's called. She knows the [witches](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,5,k56.%20cauldron) are interested in it, and have made at least one report to someone she can't see about it, as well as Strahd's status.

# So You Want To Know About Baba Lysaga...

## Van Richten

* Rumored to be as old as Barovia itself, if not older. Very powerful witch (not a hag).
* Has chosen to wage war against the Keepers of the Feather, because they oppose Strahd.
* He has not looked into Baba Lysaga specifically.

## Ezmerelda

* Has not heard any news of Baba Lysaga, aside from hearing that she inhabits the swamp and can occasionally be seen flying about by travelers south of Vallaki.
* Knows that someone keeps in contact with a coven of witches in Castle Ravenloft.
  * The witches regularly report on the status of Strahd, as well as what they call "your heart". Ezmerelda suspects they are referring to the enormous crystal heart hanging in the tower the witches' den is adjacent to. 

## Players

* Vain, egotistical, arrogant, and fiercely intelligent
* An ancient witch, who you should NOT make deals with or take gifts from

# How to Mess with Baba Lysaga?

* Talk with the PCs about "What are our liabilities?" and "And our assets?" and come up with something clever lol
* Work in the Wolf Musk somehow
* Comment on how "The most dangerous monsters in the world are people. Inconsistent, ruthless, adaptable... all the worst traits to have in a monster."
