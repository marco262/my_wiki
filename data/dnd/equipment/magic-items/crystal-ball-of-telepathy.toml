description = "<p>The typical <em>crystal ball</em>, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the <em>_[[[spell:scrying]]]_</em> spell (save DC 17) with it.</p><p>The following <em>crystal ball</em> variants are legendary items and have additional properties.</p><p><strong>Crystal Ball of Telepathy.</strong> While _[[[spell:scrying]]]_ with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the <em>_[[[spell:suggestion]]]_</em> spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this <em>_[[[spell:suggestion]]]_</em> to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if <em>_[[[spell:scrying]]]_</em> ends. Once used, the <em>_[[[spell:suggestion]]]_</em> power of the <em>crystal ball</em> can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>"
