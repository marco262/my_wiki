> During the Third Astral Era, Queen Gunnhildr united the fragmented tribes of Hrothgar to rise up and drove off the Allagans, eventually going on to found the nation of Bozja.

Hrothgar had a difficult start in the world initially, lacking knowledge of the common tongue of the land, they often found themselves at odds with their more well spoken races of the world. In time these fiercely misunderstood people managed to learn the language of the land and peace was brokered between them and the other races. Afterwards, a friendly neighbourly relationship formed between their home nation of Bozja and the rest of the world.

## Claws, Fur and Fury

The Hrothgar are a powerful people who boast broad frames, feline reflexes and fierce appearances which are marked by their sharp claws and pointed fangs. Their race suffers from having a large disproportion between the males and females of their kind, which males make up a staggering number of their kin. This has also led to the Hrothgar to adopt a matriarchy in their homeland which rallied many, but drove many away as well, leading to them becoming known as The Lost.

## A Question of Servitude

The Hrothgar split into two distinct groups of people over their ways of life coming into conflict. The Helions, who are easily identified by the warm colours of their fur, were found mainly in the southern parts of their homeland and their lives revolved around their Queen. General most Helions are devout servants to their Queen.

In comparison The Lost boasted a more free spirited, nomadic life style, wanting to live their lives unbound by the whims of a Queen. As they live as nomads they often practice various professions from seasonal work, to mercenary, to merchant. Often they avoid professions which will force them  to put roots down. Their fur is often coloured in cool hues, which is said to reflect their independence and the choice to leave the warm embrace of their Queen.

## War Torn Homeland

The Hrothgar hail from a tropical region in Southern Ilsabard known as Bozja. Born of an intense struggle against the allagan empire centuries ago, Bozja is lead by Queen Gunnhildr, a title bestowed upon the woman with the greatest aptitude for a rare power of future sight, who goes on to select her successor. Due to a severe accident that leveled the capital city, Bozja has become a war torn land controlled by the Garlean Empire, dutifully fought for by a resistance of patriots trying to save their homeland.

## It's My Life

The Hrothgar have seen their kind split based on lifestyle choices between servitude and freedom. This ideological decision drives these people forward, the Helions setting off on adventure in the name of their Queen to protect her or their homeland, while for The Lost adventure is a key part of their existence, needing to constantly travel to survive.
