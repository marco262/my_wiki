description = """
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of it kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells: _[[[spell:cure wounds]]]_ (3rd level), _[[[spell:dispel magic]]]_, _[[[spell:fly]]]_, _[[[spell:invisibility]]]_, _[[[spell:levitate]]]_,_[[[spell:protection from energy]]]_ (lightning only), _[[[spell:protection from evil and good]]]_. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.
