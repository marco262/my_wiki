A combat medic is an artificer who has developed mechanisms by which to support others in battle beyond their infusions or magic items, keeping their allies' vigor up and prolonging their usefulness in battle.

## Tool Proficiency

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You gain proficiency with the healer's kit. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

## Combat Medic Spells

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Combat Medic Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

**Combat Medic Spells**

||~ Artificer Level ||~ Combat Medic Spells ||
|| 3rd || _[[[spell:healing word]]]_, _[[[spell:shield of faith]]]_ ||
|| 5th || _[[[spell:healing spirit]]]_, _[[[spell:warding bond]]]_ ||
|| 9th || _[[[spell:beacon of hope]]]_, _[[[spell:life transference]]]_ ||
|| 13th || _[[[spell:aura of purity]]]_, _[[[spell:death ward]]]_ ||
|| 17th || _[[[spell:circle of power]]]_, _[[[spell:mass cure wounds]]]_ ||

## Aether Turret

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You have developed an aetherically-empowered turret that sits sheathed upon your back when not in use. You can mentally command it to float over your shoulder, requiring no action, or return it to your back in the same manner.

Your Aether Turret is a magical ranged weapon that you are proficient with. It deals 1d6 force damage, with a range of 30/120 feet. When attacking with your Aether Turret, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

The Aether Turret's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 9th level (2d6), 13th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

## Aetheric Link

_3rd-level Combat Medic feature_

You have learned to achieve an arcane connection with an ally, which lets you channel aether to them during combat to help keep them invigorated and fighting ready. As an action, you choose a willing creature you can see to give them your Aetheric Link. This link lasts until you give it to another creature, or you finish a long rest.

Whenever you deal damage with your Aether Turret, the creature with your Aetheric Link gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you dealt.

## Aetheric Burst

_5th-level Combat Medic feature_

When you cast an artificer spell, you may choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Roll a d6. Each of those creatures earn that many temporary hit points.

## Aetheric Charge

_9th-level Combat Medic feature_

When the creature with your Aetheric Link loses all temporary hit points they have, you gain an Aetheric Charge. You may only ever have one Aetheric Charge at a time, and it dissipates when you finish a short or long rest.

You have two options for how to expend your Aetheric Charge:

* **Turret Overcharge.** When you attack with your Aether Turret, you can expend your Aetheric Charge to increase its damage by 2d6.
* **Aether Bomb.** As an action, you can expend your Aetheric Charge and choose a point within 30 feet of you. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw vs your spell save DC. A creature takes 3d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you damage any creature with this ability, the creature with your Aetheric Link gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the number you rolled for damage.   

## Expedient Aid

_15th-level Combat Medic feature_

You have learned to manage your efforts to provide assistance to your allies faster than ever. You can make a weapon attack, throw an Aether Bomb, or cast an artificer spell as a bonus action, rather than an action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
