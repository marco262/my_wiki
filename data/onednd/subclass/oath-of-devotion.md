**Tenets of Devotion**

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, Paladins of this oath share these tenets.

***Honesty.*** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.  
***Courage.*** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.  
***Compassion.*** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.  
***Honor.*** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them.  
***Duty.*** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

The Oath of Devotion binds a Paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. 

### 3rd Level: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath gives you the following benefits:

**Prepared Spells.** You always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. These spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare, and they follow the rules of this class's Spellcasting feature.

**Free Casting.** You can cast one of your prepared spells from this feature without expending a Spell Slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you use this benefit again.
