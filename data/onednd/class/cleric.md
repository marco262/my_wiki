**Class Group:** Priest  
**Primary Ability:** Wisdom

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes -- where gods dwell -- and channel that energy to bolster people and to battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples or shrines dedicated to whatever deity or other immortal force unlocked their magical ability. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training, yet a Cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites that help them focus their minds and spirits on drawing power from the Outer Planes. Even a Cleric who declines to worship their divine benefactor might perform their benefactor's rites if doing so helps the Cleric feel connected to the immortal realms.

Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Some of the most influential high priests are incapable of harnessing divine magic, and a few of them feel threatened when a Cleric appears. Many can pray, and some mortals claim to speak for the gods. But few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

**Multiclassing and the Cleric**

If your group uses the multiclassing rules in the _Player's Handbook_, here's what you need to know if you choose Cleric as one of your Classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have a score of at least 13 in the Cleric's primary ability, Wisdom, to take a level in this Class or to take a level in another Class if you are already a Cleric.

***Armor Training.*** When you gain your first Cleric level, you gain Armor Training with the following: Light Armor, Medium Armor, and Shields.

***Spell Slots.*** Add all your Cleric levels to the appropriate levels from other Classes to determine your available Spell Slots for casting Spells, as detailed in the multiclassing rules.

You prepare Spells for each of your Classes individually, referring to the Spell Slots of an individual Class to determine the number and levels of the Spells you prepare for it.

## Cleric Class Features

As a Cleric, you gain the following Class Features when you reach the specified levels in this Class. These features are listed on the Cleric table.

### 1st Level: Channel Divinity

You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create, and you gain additional effect options at higher levels in this Class.

You can use your Channel Divinity a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Some Channel Divinity effects require Saving Throws. When you use such an effect from this Class, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this Class's Spellcasting feature.

***Divine Spark.*** As a Magic Action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at them. Roll a number of d8s equal to your Proficiency Bonus and add the rolls together. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Radiant Damage equal to the total, and on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (rounded down).

***Turn Undead.*** As a Magic Action, you present your Holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring Undead creatures. Each Undead within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw. If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it is Dazed for 1 minute or until it takes any damage or you are Incapacitated or die. While Dazed in this way, the only Action the creature can take is the Dash Action, and if it Moves, it must end that Move farther from you than where it started. 

### 1st Level: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast Spells through prayer, meditation, and devotion. See the _Player's Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Cleric.

***Prepared Spells.*** You have the following Spells prepared: _[Cure Wounds](/onednd/spell/Cure Wounds)_, _[Sacred Flame](/onednd/spell/Sacred Flame)_, _[Shield of Faith](/onednd/spell/Shield of Faith)_, _[Spare the Dying](/onednd/spell/Spare the Dying)_, and _[Thaumaturgy](/onednd/spell/Thaumaturgy)_. Alternatively, you can prepare three 0-level Spells (also known as cantrips) and two 1st-level Spells of your choice. Any Spell you prepare for this Class must be a [Divine](/onednd/general/Spellcasting Rules#divine-spells) Spell.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can pray or meditate and replace any Spell you have prepared for this Class with another Divine Spell of the same level.

At higher levels in this Class, you can prepare more Spells, as shown on the Cleric table. The numbers there determine the number of different Spells you can prepare of each level. For example, as a 4th-level Cleric, you can prepare four different 0-level Spells, four different 1st-level Spells, and three different 2nd-level Spells.

Consult the "Prepared Cleric Spells" section for recommendations on which spells to prepare at higher levels.

***Spell Slots.*** The Cleric table shows how many Spell Slots you have at each level to cast your Cleric Spells of 1st level and higher; the number of different Spells you can prepare of each level equals the number of Spell Slots you have at that level. For example, as a 5th-level Cleric, you have four 1st-level Spell Slots, three 2nd-level Spell Slots, and two 3rd-level Spell Slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Cleric Spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for the Spells you prepare for this Class. 

### 2nd Level: Holy Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles, either on your own or as part of a religious order. Choose one of the following options:

* **Protector.** Trained for battle, you gain Martial Weapon Proficiency and Heavy Armor Training.
* **Scholar.** Studying and teaching about lore of the gods and the multiverse, you gain Proficiency in two of the following Skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Nature, Persuasion, and Religion. Whenever you make an Ability Check using either Skill, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom Modifier.
* **Thaumaturge.** Delving deeper into your divine magical abilities, you can prepare one extra 0-level Spell from the [Divine Spell list](/onednd/general/Spellcasting Rules#divine-spells). See your Spellcasting feature for more information on preparing Spells. In addition, you regain one expended use of your Channel Divinity whenever you finish a Short Rest.

### 3rd Level: Cleric Subclass

You gain the [Life Domain](/onednd/subclass/Life Domain) Subclass or another Cleric Subclass of your choice. The Life Domain is detailed after the Cleric's Class description, and other Subclasses will appear in future _Unearthed Arcana_ articles.

A Subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your Subclass's features that are of your Cleric level and lower. This Class's description tells you the levels when your Subclass provides features. 

### 4th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 5th Level: Smite Undead

You can cause your Turn Undead feature to smite the undying; whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Proficiency Bonus and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its Saving Throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant Damage equal to the roll's total. 

### 6th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Cleric Subclass. 

### 7th Level: Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your 0-level Spells or your attacks with Weapons, you can also deal 1d8 Radiant Damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn. 

### 8th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 9th Level: Holy Order

Your sacred duties have expanded, allowing you to choose a second option from the Holy Order feature. 

### 10th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Cleric Subclass. 

### 11th Level: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

As an Action, describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Cleric level, the divine power intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Divine Spell is appropriate.

If the intervention occurs, you can't use this feature again for 2d6 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest. 

### 12th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 14th Level: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Cleric Subclass. 

### 16th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 18th Level: Greater Divine Intervention

When you use your Divine Intervention feature, it succeeds automatically -- no roll required -- and you can use it again after 2d4 days. 

### 19th Level: Feat

You gain the Ability Score Improvement Feat or another Feat of your choice for which you qualify. 

### 20th Level: Epic Boon

You gain the Epic Boon of Fate or another Epic Boon Feat of your choice.
