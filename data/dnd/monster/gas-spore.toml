***Death Burst.*** The gas spore explodes when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or take 10 ({@damage 3d6}) poison damage and become infected with a disease on a failed save. Creatures immune to the {@condition poisoned} condition are immune to this disease.

Spores invade an infected creature's system, killing the creature in a number of hours equal to {@dice 1d12} + the creature's Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. In half that time, the creature becomes {@condition poisoned} for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it sprouts {@dice 2d4} Tiny gas spores that grow to full size in 7 days.

***Eerie Resemblance.*** The gas spore resembles a beholder. A creature that can see the gas spore can discern its true nature with a successful {@dc 15} Intelligence (Nature) check.
