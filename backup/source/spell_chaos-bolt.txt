description: "You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.\n\n||~ d8 ||~ Damage Type ||\n|| 1 || Acid ||\n|| 2 || Cold ||\n|| 3 || Fire ||\n|| 4 || Force ||\n|| 5 || Lightning ||\n|| 6 || Poison ||\n|| 7 || Psychic ||\n|| 8 || Thunder ||\n\nIf you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell."
