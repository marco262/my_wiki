You summon the awesome presence of a Medium Fey spirit in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can immediately make one melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the spirit. On a hit, the target takes Psychic damage equal to 3d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn.

As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of the space it left and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.
