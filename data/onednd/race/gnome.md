Gnomes are magical folk created by gods of hard work, invention, trickery, and life underground. The earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes' secretive nature and their propensity for lairing in sylvan forests, hillside burrows, and sprawling warrens under mountains. What they lacked in size, they made up for in cleverness and cunning. They confounded predators with elaborate traps and low, narrow, labyrinthine tunnels. They also learned useful magic from gods like Garl Glittergold, Baervan Wildwanderer, and Baravar Cloakshadow, who often lived among them (usually in disguise).

Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes, pointed ears, and wistful imaginations. Harkening back to a time when their ancestors hid in tunnels and under thick forest canopies, many gnomes like the feeling of a roof over their head, even if that "roof" is nothing more than a hat.

## Gnome Traits

* **Creature Type:** Humanoid
* **Size:** Small (about 3â€“4 feet tall)
* **Speed:** 30 feet
* **Life Span:** 425 years on average

As a Gnome, you have these special traits.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Gnomish Cunning.*** You have Advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Gnomish Lineage.*** You are part of a gnomish lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose a lineage from the Gnomish Lineages table: Forest Gnome, the lineage of magic-filled forests, or Rock Gnome, the lineage of primeval mountains. You gain the benefits of that lineage.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the Spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).

### Gnomish Lineages

#### Forest Gnome

* You know the _[[[spell:Minor Illusion]]]_ Cantrip.
* You can also cast the _[[[spell:Speak with Animals]]]_ Spell with this trait. You can cast it with the trait a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You can also use any Spell Slots you have to cast the Spell.

#### Rock Gnome

* You know the _[[[spell:Mending]]]_ and _[[[spell:Prestidigitation]]]_ cantrips.
* In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting _Prestidigitation_ to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, a fire starter, or a music box. Casting the Spell in this way consumes 10 GP worth of raw material (string, gears, and the like), which you provide during the casting.<br> When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from _Prestidigitation_; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to touch the device and activate it. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both.<br> You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each one dismantles itself 8 hours after its creation. You can also touch one of your devices and dismantle it as an Action. After a device is dismantled, the 10 GP of materials used to create it can be reclaimed.
